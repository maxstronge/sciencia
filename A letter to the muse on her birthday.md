# A letter to the muse on her birthday

Sing, my muse, of the deaf and blinded stone,
who was driven far and wide by your affect and your heart
and in your wake remembered what it did not know it lost - 
with senses o'erwhelmed by her true zeal,
the rock again could see, and hear,
and feel.

I have to start with an apology - not just because of the neuroticism, but because I'm embarrassed at how long it took to get this letter to you. I've always been good with words, with writing. My whole life, I believed that for any idea, any concept, it was possible to find the right sequence of words, in the right order, that would translate the exact nature of the thing in my head to the page, such that anyone reading it would have no other choice than to join me in whatever conclusion I had drawn. 

Like so many other things, you've shattered that old idea in the most beautiful, surprising way. I've been trying for months to find the words that will show you what you mean to me. They never came. I started, and restarted, and restarted again, and each time it got harder, because being with you only got easier. Any other person, and the letter would be written, maybe several times over - glossy language and artificially sweet nothings would flow right out. This I cannot do with you - you know me too well for anything but the most genuine, unadorned thoughts to ring true. 


A relationship in itself is a difficult thing to define. Both of us have loved before, but there is something fundamentally new every time - the feeling, the energy, is never quite the same. From the perspective of a materialist (which I am, to a certain extent), the only way I can think to define a relationship is this: it is the sum of every memory we have co-authored, every emotion we've felt when our gazes lock. Every errant thought and distracted daydream is not just mine, but yours too. Uniquely ours. That mosaic, the collective of everything we mutually feel, is what words can't convey. 

Luckily, I don't think I have to anymore. The mosaic is ours, ours and ours alone. It exists in us, in our memories, and in our thoughts about the future, invisible to any observer, but ever-so-tangible to us as we live and love and elaborate upon it. 

But the future is not much of a gift in the present. I was guarded for a long time, for one Latin American reason or another, from telling you how I really felt - and since my memory of you is our story, you deserve to know it from my side. 

The first time I texted you was January 11, 2022 - I was already overwhelmed and more than a little intimidated by you. A couple days before that, after some professional stalking, I had already told my mom about you - the award-winning, news-making, head-turning co-worker that had every advantage over me. I was nervous before, but after stalking you, the imposter syndrome surged like hairspray through a match. The first thing you ever said to me:

"Yes of course, thanks for getting back to me so quickly! I realized I am far too embarrassed by my discord presence to inflict that on you hah so I'm glad you texted."

The second thing:

"Individually, all the pieces aren't bad. But all together, they imply a deeply disturbed individual."

In hindsight, not the worst introduction. You were so well-behaved at the beginning. And then we were making the little quiz with the different types of printing material, and then we met in person.

Our actual meeting was delayed several times - you invited me to the library so we could learn inventor. I was falling behind in classes and couldn't make it on the days you suggested. I didn't know your relationship status at the time, so I was trying *really* hard not to develop any kind of crush-like feelings. But you suggested we do it over zoom and I had to very carefully act like I wasn't very very interested in meeting you in person. 

The next chance was dashed too, since you weren't able to come to the little Meet & Greet video chat. I saw everyone else for the first time, including a very attractive Latina that I quickly ruled out any future activity with. Hindsight again, maybe I should've trusted that impulse. But you had something else to do, and so the first time I ever saw you in person was February 4th. You took a wrong turn and ended up very lost (like I was, 2 hours earlier), so William and I came and waited for you by Hippocrates. And then you walked over in your flustered and oh-so-appealing way. I was taken completely off my guard, because like my futile attempts at letter-writing, your photos didn't come close to doing you justice. I'm lucky that I had the advantage of not being the late one, because if the roles were reversed and I was late and scrambled in to find you waiting there at the statue, I might not have said another word all day. It was exhilarating, but it didn't feel like a life-changing moment. Turns out, it was. 

Some time after that you politely dropped the words '...my boyfriend...', and even though I was so actively repressing whatever burgeoning feelings existed at the time, my heart still caught in my chest. I told myself it was relief, since now there was nothing to worry about, no hope or risk of anything. Once again, hindsight makes things funnier. But even once there was an unambigous sign that it was time to close off, you kept touching my arm. Just light little touches, accompanied by the flat-toned deadpan '...you're funny' I would grow to hate (and then love). Just a friendly gesture, but every time your skin touched mine it was electric. At the time, it had been years since I was touched like that. 

But you were coupled, and a little later I found out the length of that relationship, and so I closed the door. Even then, you took up an inappropriate amount of my thoughts that night, and the night after, and the one after that, quite against my own free will, to the extent that such a thing exists. 

We kept growing closer after that, steadily, and equally against my will. January turns to February, et cetera. I named the printers, you named your cats. Your emoji use began to confuse me, and had I not gotten such explicit confirmation to the contrary, I would've thought you were flirting. 
February 24th, you shared your art with me for the first time - it was Ciri, and I was surprised, not only because you just sent it to me with no discussion or warning, but because it was actually rather good, and it's deeply unfair that people can be so impressive in scientific *and* artistic endeavors. 

I didn't send you anything I made until May. I've never sent my art to anyone else to this day. Anonymous reddit posts don't feel quite as vulnerable. 

At this time, you were trying very hard to get me and Lyndsey together. This side-quest never went anywhere, but it did get me to see you outside the lab for the first time. The first game night you invited me to was 'cancelled' due to a 'hockey game' or something, so I was pretty sure the invite was just out of politeness and not a genuine desire to become more than work-friends. 

Then it actually did happen. An hour before I left, you dropped out of nowhere that you were very recently single (as a warning for the potentially crusty vibes), and that threw me for a bit of a loop, but by this point I was thoroughly convinced that you thought of me as more of a basketball-eating eccentricity than anything you might be attracted to. Game night was fun, your friends were delightful. I never came again, but the workplace barrier had been broken.

On the 27th of June, I asked you if I was crazy, or if Nicole was flirting with me. This led to a very long-tumultuous sidequest, the details of which are familiar to you - but at 11:44PM, you told me:

"I already know you’re going to do it anyways but just know when the dust settles I’ll be here to say I told you so ❤️"

And you were. 

I've thought about this for a very long time now, and I don't regret the sidequest. It wasn't a waste of time. We weren't ready for each other yet. 

July 2nd: an entry for 'Egyptian Tornado' is anonymously posted on the internet. For unrelated reasons, you told me

'I promise...i'll remember you forever'

I hope this part comes true too. 

The very next day was a Thursday, and a series of extremely unlikely events once again conspired to change our lives. There was allegedly a game night planned, but in a twist of utter serendipity, Lyndsey dropped off the face of the Earth and your plans were dashed. The night nearly ended there. I decided to be a little tiny bit braver than usual and asked if that meant you were free that night. I deleted it 10 seconds later. 

To my great fortune, you saw it. 

I got home five hours later and Thursday became my favorite day of the week. 

Exactly seven Thursdays later I became aware that I was falling in love with you. August 25th. I was reeling from having 32 shards of what used to be my wisdom tooth ripped out of my jaw. You were captivating enough to make it one of the best nights of the year. Night market. Sitting by the river. Cheesecake for the mice.  

Every time I saw you after that only made me want you more. I was far from at my best - September was the slow-motion decline and fall of my side-questing activities, and it felt like I was drowning. Your couch on Thursdays (and other days, because by then we had given up on pretending we only wanted to see each other once a week) became such a refuge for me. You gave me such solace in some of my hardest days, and I can never thank you enough for that gift. But something had joined us in your basement. I'm not sure when exactly it got there, or when I noticed it, but it grew every minute we spent together. There was an elephant in the room.

The side-quest came to an end shortly before my birthday. On Oct. 10th the elephant had simply become too big to ignore. So I decided to be a tiny bit braver than usual for the second time, and I asked you if you saw it too. I knew you wanted...something, but I was still so scared. And then the kiss. And things were different, but in a much more real way, they were exactly the same, and that's the best part.  

After that night I dispensed with not telling you exactly how I felt about you. So you know the rest, because after that night, there's no difference between my memory and ours. 

This  [he gestures to all of it] is something really special, Heide. I think you know it. Nothing in life comes this easily unless it's meant to happen. It's been my pleasure to have spent a year with you - I hope it's the first of many. I still don't know the words that could explain how I feel about you, and how lucky I am to have stumbled into your life. Nobody else would understand it. But I hope that this was the right sequence of words to make you, and only you, realize what you mean to me. 

It broke my heart to see you go through some of your worst days this year. In the words of one of my other muses, Mark Hoppus of Blink 182: nobody likes you when you're 23. SSRIs, demonic birth control implants, tumult with friends, with family, in relationships, and in yourself - you've gone through a lot and grown so much. I haven't been around that long and even I can see it. Now that you've advanced to an age where people like you a little more, I hope that there was enough good in your last trip around the sun to give you confidence that all the hurt you've pushed through has only made you that much wiser, stronger, and more resilient. And I'm so so lucky that I get to copilot with you on your next lap (and, if I'm lucky, more after that). 


I am sorry that it took so long to find the words. I hope you can see this for what it really is - a compliment more genuine than any combination of clever words and phrases. You are an unknown language, untranslatable (like all the best words), and yet the meaning you carry is magnetic. Like a lodestone, I am drawn to you and your endless uniquity, because I simply cannot resist whatever it is about you that stupefies me so much. 

TL;DR:

Mon coeur. My muse. 

I'm really glad I met you. Happy birthday, Heide. 

Your favorite rock,
-Max
