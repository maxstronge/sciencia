# The Rotational Motion of Rigid Bodies:
***

A **rigid body** is a collection of *N* particles with the property that its shape cannot change - that is, the distance between any two of its constituent particles is fixed. 

A perfectly rigid body is, of course, an idealization, but it turns out to be an extremely useful one, to which many real systems are extremely good approximations. In many ways, a rigid body comprised of *N* particles is much simpler to analyze than an arbitrary system of *N* particles: the arbitrary system requires 3*N* coordinates to specify its configuration (3 spatial coordinates for each particle), while any rigid body will require only 6 coordinates; 3 to specify the position of the **center of mass**,  and 3 to specify the rest of the body's orientation relative to that center of mass. Further, we shall see that the motion of a rigid body can be divided into two simpler separate problems: the translational motion of the center of mass, and the rotational motion of the body about the center of mass. 

We will begin the chapter with some general results, mostly pertaining to the CM of a rigid body. These results generalize previously found results for 2 particles, and most of them apply to any arbitrary system of *N* particles. We will then quickly specialize these results to the motion of a rigid body, the most interesting aspect of which is the rotational motion.
