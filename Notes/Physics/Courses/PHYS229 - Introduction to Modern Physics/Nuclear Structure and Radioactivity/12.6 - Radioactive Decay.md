# 12.6 - Radioactive Decay:
***

Above is a plot of all the known nuclei. For the lighter stable nuclei, the proton and neutron numbers are roughly equal, as shown by the fit line $N=Z$. As the nuceli get more massive, however, the factor $Z(Z-1)$ in the [[12.4 - The Nuclear Force#^d7e83c|Coulomb repulsion energy]] grows rapidly, so *exra neutrons are needed to supply the additional binding energy needed for stability.* For this reason, all heavy nuclei have $N>Z$.

Most of the nuclei in the figure above are **unstable**, which means that *they transform themselves into more stable nuclei by changing their Z and N through either* [[12.7 - Alpha Decay|alpha decay]] (emission of $^4He$) or [[12.8 - Beta Decay|beta decay]] (neutron $\to$ proton, or vice versa). 

Nuclei are unstable in excited states, which can transition to ground states through [[12.9 - Gamma Decay and Nuclear Excited States|gamma decay]] (emission of photons).

These three decay processes (alpha, beta, and gamma) are the general subject of **radioactive decay**. In the remainder of this section, we establish some of the basic properties of radioactive decay before treating each type in more detail. 

***

The *rate* at which unstable radioactive nuclei decay in a sample of material is called the **activity** of the sample. The greater the activity, the more nuclear decays per second. The activity has nothing to do with the type of decay, only the rate. 

The basic unit for measuring activity is the **curie**, after Marie Curie. Originally, the definition of the curie was derived from the activity of one gram of **radium**, but that definition has since been updated to a more convenient one:

> #### 1 curie (*Ci*) $= 3.7 \times 10^{10} \frac{\text{decays}}{s}.$

One curie is a very large activity, so it is more common to work with units of **millicurie**  ($mCi$), equal to $10^{-3}$*Ci*, and **microcurie** ($\mu Ci$), equal to $10^{-6}$*Ci*.

Consider a sample with a mass of a few grams, containing ~$10^{23}$ atoms. If the activity were as large as 1 *Ci*, about $10^{10}$ of the nuclei in the sample would decay each second. 

We could also say that for any one nucleus, the *probability* of decaying during each second is about $10^{10}/10^{23}$, or $10^{-13}$. This quantity, the *decay probability per nucelus per second*, is called the **decay constant**, represented by the symbol $\lambda$. We assume that $\lambda$ is  a small number, and that it is *constant in time* for any particular material - 	*the probability of any one nucelus decaying does not depend on the age of the sample*.

The activity *a* depends on the number *N* of radioactive nuclei in the sample and also on the probability $\lambda$ for each nucelus to decay:

> ## $$a = \lambda N $$
...which is equivalent to *decays/s* = *decays/s per nucleus $\times$ number of nuclei.*


Both *a* and *N* are functions of the time, *t*. As our sample decays, *N* clearly decreases, as once a nucleus has decayed it is usually no longer radioactive, and so the number of radioactive nuclei will decrease over time. If *N* decreases and $\lambda$ remains constant, clearly *a* must also decrease with time, and so *the number of decays per second becomes smaller over time*.

We can also regard *a* as **the change in the number of radioactive nuclei per unit time**: the more nuclei decay per second, the larger *a* will be. 

> ## $$a = -\frac{dN}{dt}. $$

The minus sign must be present because $dN$/$dt$ is negative, as N is decreasing with time, and we want *a* to be a positive value. Combining these two equations, we have:

> ## $$\frac{dN}{N} = - \lambda\; dt $$

 ...which can be integrated directly to yield...
 
 > ## $$N = N_0e^{-\lambda t} $$
 > ...where $N_0$ represents **the number of radioactive nuclei present at time $t=0$.**

This is the **exponential law of radioactive decay**, which tells us how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases over time. 

It's not easy to directly measure N, however, so we can cast this equation in a more useful form by multiplying both sides by $\lambda$, which gives:

> ## $$a = a_0e^{-\lambda t} $$
> ...where $a_0$ is the original activity at time $t=0$ ($a_0= \lambda N_0$).

Above is a plot of *a* as a function of time. It is often more useful, though, to plot this function on a semilogarithmic scale:

![[Pasted image 20210419144852.png]]

Plotted this way we see a straight line with slope $- \lambda$. 

The **half-life**, $t_{1/2}$, of the decay is *the time that it takes for the activity to be reduced by half*, as is shown in both plots. That is, when $t=t_{1/2}$,$a = \frac{1}{2}a_0=a_0e^{-\lambda t_{1/2}}$, from which we find:

> ### $$t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\ln(2) = \frac{0.693}{\lambda}. $$

Another useful parameter is the **mean lifetime** $\tau$:

> ## $$\tau = \frac{1}{\lambda}. $$


When $t = \tau$, $a = a_0e^{-1} = 0.37a_0$.

## Conservation Laws in Radioactive Decays:

Several important conservation laws limit the possible outcomes of radioactive decay:

***

 ### 1. **Conservation of Energy**:
 
 Conservation of energy tells us which decays are *energetically possible* , and enables us to calculate rest energies or kinetic energies of decay products. 
 
 A nucleus *X* will decay into a lighter nucleus *X'*, with the emission of one or more particles we collectively call *'x'* **only if** the rest energy of *X* is greater than the total rest energy of $X' + x$. The excess rest energy is known as the ***Q* value** of the decay $X \to X' + x$:
 
 
>##  $$Q = [m_x - (m_{x'}+m_x)]\,c^2. $$ 

^a5df4d

 ...where the *m's* represent *nuclear masses*. This decay is only possible if the *Q* value is positive. The excess energy *Q* appears as the kinetic energy of the decay products (assuming *X* is initally at rest):
 
 > ## $$Q=K_{X'}+K_X. $$

 ***
 
 ### 2.  **Conservation of Linear Momentum**:

^f18838

 
 If the initially decaying nucelus is at rest, then the total linear momentum of all the decay products is zero:
 
 > ## $$\vec p_{X'} \,+\,\vec p_X = 0. $$

Usually, the emitted particles are 	much less massive than the residual nucleus *X'*, and the **recoil momentum** $p_{X'}$ yields a very small kinetic energy $K_{X'}$. 

If there is only one emitted particle *x*, the previous two equations can be solved directly for $K_{X'}$ and $K_X$. If *x* represents two or more particles, there is no unique solution to the system of equations (more unknowns than variables).

***

 ### 3.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum**:

^928114

 
 The total spin angular momentum of the initial particle before the decay must equal the total angular momentum (spin plus orbital) of all of the product particles after the decay.
 
For example, the decay of a neutron (spin angular momentum = $\frac{1}{2}$) into a proton plus an electron is forbidden by conservation of angular momentum, because the spins of the proton and electron, each equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, can be combined to give a total of either 0 or 1, neither of which is equal to the initial angular momentum of the neutron. Adding integer units of orbital angular momentum to the electron does not restore angular momentum conservation in this decay process.

***

### 4.  **Conservation of Electric Charge**:

This is so fundamental it hardly needs elaboration.
***
### 5.  **Conservation of Nucelon Number**:

In some decay processes, we can create particles (eg. photons or electrons) that did not exist prior to the decay. This of course, requires energy - but nature does *not* permit us to create or destroy nucleons, so while we can change a proton into a neutron or vice versa, *the total nucelon number A does not change in decay processes.* *Z* and *N* must both change in such a way that their sum remains constant.
