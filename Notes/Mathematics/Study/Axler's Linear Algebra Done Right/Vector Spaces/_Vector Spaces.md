Linear algebra is the study of **linear maps** on **finite-dimensional vector spaces**. Hopefully by the end of this we'll understand all those terms. we start by defining **vector spaces** and discuss their elementary properties.

Linear algebra benefits greatly from the introduction of **complex numbers** - thus, we will begin by reintroducing the complex numbers and their basic properties. 

We will generalize the examples of a **plane** and ordinary space to **$R^n$** and **$C^n$**, which we will then generalize to the notion of a **vector space**.
