### Review of Functions:

If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a<b$, the **interval** $[a,b]$ is defined to be *the set of all real numbers* $x$ such that $a\leq x \leq b$.

A (real-valued) function $f$ on $[a,b]$ is a **rule** that associates to every number $x$ in $[a,b]$ a real number, denoted $f(x)$. The rule is typically specified by giving a formula for $f(x)$ in terms of x. 


The set of all functions on $[a,b]$ is denoted 	$\bf{F}\,[a,b]$. Two functions $f$ and $g$ in $\bf{F}\,[a,b]$ are **equal** if $f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x$ in the domain of **F**, and we describe this by saying that $f$ and $g$ have the same **action** (given the same input, they map to the same output - functions are equivalent).
