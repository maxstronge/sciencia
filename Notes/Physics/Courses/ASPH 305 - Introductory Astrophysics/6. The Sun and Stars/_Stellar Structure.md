# Stellar Structure:

***

The stars are massive spheres of gas, which go on shining steadily for billions of years in a continual nuclear explosion. The energy radiated by stars does not change much over the scale of ~$4$ billion years (as seen in the prehistory of our own planet). Therefore, the *equilibrium* of a star must remain stable for extremely long periods of time.
