### Radiation of Atoms and Molecules:

Electromagnetic is emitted or absorbed when an atom or molecule moves from one *energy level* to another. If the energy of an atom decreases by an amount $\Delta E$, then the atom emits/radiates a *quantum* of electromagnetic radiation called a *photon*, whose frequency $\nu$ is given by the equation:

> ### $$\Delta E = h \nu.$$

[See earlier work on [[3.2 - The Photoelectric Effect]] for further exploration.]

Similarly, if an atom receives or absorbs a photon of a frequency $\nu$, its energy *increases* by $\Delta E = h \nu.$

### Blackbody Radiation:

A **blackbody** is defined as an object that does *not* reflect or scatter any radiation incident upon it, but absorbs and re-emits the radiation completely. 

Blackbodies are idealized radiators and as such cannot physically exist, but they serve as an excellent approximation for many sufficiently dense bodies. 

The radiation of a blackbody depends entirely on its temperature $T$, being perfectly independent of the body's shape or material composition. 

The *wavelength distribution* of blackbody radiation follows **Planck's Law** (which is a function of temperature only). The intensity at a frequency $\nu$ of a blackbody at temperature $T$ is given by:

>  $$B_v(T) = B(v;T) = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h \nu / k T}-1}$$
