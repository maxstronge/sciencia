### Phase 1: Research and Planning

1. **Identify Key Features**: List out all the features you want to implement, prioritize them, and compare them against the features available in Mathematica.
2. **Select Technologies**: Decide on the technology stack. For the frontend, you might look at web-based frameworks like React or Vue.js. For the backend, Python is an excellent choice, especially with libraries like SymPy for symbolic mathematics.
3. **Architecture Design**: Sketch out the architecture of your system. Decide how the frontend and backend will interact, possibly through REST APIs or WebSockets.

### Phase 2: Core Backend Development

1. **Setup Python Environment**: Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.
2. **Integrate SymPy**: Import SymPy and create a wrapper class that will handle the basic functionalities like symbolic algebra and derivatives.
3. **Implement Decision Tree for Integration**: Design a decision tree algorithm that will choose the best method for symbolic integration.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development

1. **Initialize Frontend**: Choose a frontend framework and set up the basic structure.
2. **Latex Rendering**: Use libraries like MathJax to render Latex equations in real-time.
3. **Interactive UI Elements**: Implement features like click-and-drag for equation manipulation.
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts and Macros**: Implement a system for shortcuts like 'sr' -> $^{2}$ 

### Phase 4: Linking Frontend and Backend

1. **API Design**: Create a RESTful API or WebSocket connection to link the frontend and backend.
2. **Request Handling**: Implement the logic for making requests to the backend and displaying the results on the frontend.

### Phase 5: Implementing Advanced Features

1. **2D/3D Plotting**: Use Python libraries like Matplotlib for plotting and display them on the frontend.
2. **Vector Fields**: Add functionality for plotting vector fields.
3. **User Customization**: Allow users to add their own shortcuts or macros.

### Phase 6: Testing and Debugging

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for both frontend and backend.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the system as a whole.
3. **User Testing**: Obtain feedback from real users and iterate.

### Phase 7: Deployment and Maintenance

1. **Deployment**: Choose a deployment strategy and go live.
2. **Documentation**: Write detailed documentation for both end-users and developers.
3. **Updates and Maintenance**: Regularly update the system based on user feedback and new requirements.
