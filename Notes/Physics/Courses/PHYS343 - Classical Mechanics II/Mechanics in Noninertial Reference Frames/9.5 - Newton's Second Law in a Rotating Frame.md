# 9.5 - Newton's Second Law in a Rotating Frame: 
***

We are now ready to find the form of Newton's second law in the rotating frame $\mathbb{S}$. To simplify matters, we shall assume for now that the angular velocity $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{S}$ relative to $\mathbb{S_0}$ is constant. Surprisingly, if $\Omega$ is constant in one frame, it is automatically constant in the other! *(citation needed)*

Consider now a particle of mass *m* and position $\vec{r}$. In the inertial frame $\mathbb{S_0}$, the particle obeys Newton's second law in normal form:

> ## $$m \left( \frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt}\right)_{\mathbb{S_0}} = F$$
> ...where *F* is the net force on the particle, as usual. 

The derivative on the left is, of course, the derivative as evaluated by observers in $\mathbb{S_0}$. However, we can now use [[9.4 - Time Derivatives in a Rotating Frame#^2b7fb5|the relation just found]] to express the derivative in terms of the derivative as taken in $\mathbb{S}$:

> ## $$\left(\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right)_{S_0} = \left(\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right)_{S}+\Omega \times \vec{r}.$$

Differentiating a second time, we find that:

> $$\LARGE
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2}\right)_{S_0} & =\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)_{\mathbb{S_0}} \left(\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right)_{\mathbb{S_0}}\\
& =	\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)_{\mathbb{S_0}} \left[\left(\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}\right)_{\mathbb{S}} + \Omega \times \vec{r}\right].
\end{align}$$

Skipping a few steps and cleaning things up, we find the form of Newton's second law in a rotating frame to be:

> # $${m\ddot{r} = F + 2m\dot{r}\times\Omega+m(\Omega \times r) \times \Omega.} $$

As with the [[9.1 - Acceleration without Rotation|accelerated frame]], we find that the equation of motion in the rotating frame looks *just like* Newton's second law, except that in this case there are *two* extra force-like terms present. The first of these extra terms is called the **Coriolis force** (after French physicist *G.G. de Coriolis*, late $C_{18}$ to early $C_{19}$):

> # $$F_{cor} = 2m\dot r \times \Omega. $$

The second is the **centrifugal force** (counter to centripetal, "center-escaping" rather than seeking):

> # $$F_{cf} = m(\Omega \times r) \times \Omega. $$


Thus, in a rotating frame:

>## $$m\ddot r = F + F_{cor} + F_{cf}. $$
