# The Sun:
***

Earth orbits a star colloquially referred to as 'the Sun', 	sometimes referred to as 'Sol'. It is the nearest star, and as such is unique in that many phenomena that can only be studied indirectly (such as stellar rotation, starspots, the structure of the stellar surface) can be directly observed in our Sun. 

The present model of the Sun is based on observation and theoretical calculation. Some observations of the Sun still disagree with the current model, however, so it is incomplete, but the general picture is roughly correct (insofar as we know).
