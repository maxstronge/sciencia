# The Electromagnetic Spectrum:

***

We have covered the wave-particle duality of light extensively in [[3.2 - The Photoelectric Effect]] and [[3.1 - Review of Electromagnetic Waves]]. When talking about subatomic effects in this course, we will tend to model light as being made of particles called **photons**. Recall some important points:

- Photons travel through space at the speed of light ($c = 3\times10^8\,m/s$)
- This is the fastest attainable speed in the universe by Einstein's special relativity
- Photons are massless (but they do possess kinetic energy and momentum)


Also recall that light also behaves like (and is) an electromagnetic wave, and light waves can *interfere* with one another (either constructive interference or destructive interference). 

When treating light as a wave, we have certain notations and terminology to work with:

- Light has a *wavelength*, typically denoted by $\ll$, the distance between two successive maxima/minima of the wave - unit of distance, can range from $m$ to $fm$ (femtometers)
- The wave also has an *amplitude*, defined as the height of the wave's maxima above the mean - sometimes denoted $A$, represents energy (along with wavelength)
- Instead of wavelength, we can also refer to *frequency*, the number of wave crests that pass a certain point in one second - units of inverse time, given often as $f$ or $\nu$ (which is a Greek nu, not a v). Measured in Hertz ($Hz$).


Recall from before that we can use a simple equation to relate wavelength to frequency:


> ### $$c =  \nu \ll$$

We can see that frequency and wavelength are inversely related.

We can also find the energy of a light wave as follows:

> ### $$E = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\ll} $$

...where $h$ is Planck's Constant $= 	6.626\times10^{-34}\,J\cdot s.$

### Visible Light:

Visible light (i.e. optical light) covers the wavelength range from $4 \times 10^{-4}\,mm \to 7 \times 10^{-4}mm$ (or 400-700$nm$).

This is the range of visible light that can be seen when a beam of white light passes through a prism -- the prism separates the colors by their wavelength via refraction.

### Beyond Visible Light:
 The visible range is only a tiny portion of the entire *electromagnetic spectrum* - radiation with wavelengths greater than that of red light ($\ll = 700\,nm$) is invisible to the human eye. 
 
 Light with wavelengths between $700\,nm\text{ and }100\mu m$ is  known as **infrared** radiation. 
 
 If the light's wavelength exceeds $100\mu m$,  the waves are considered **radio** waves. 
 
 In the other direction, light with wavelengths between $400\,nm\text{ and }1\,nm$ is **ultraviolet** radiation.
 
 From $\ll = 1\,nm \text{ to }1\times 10^{-4}\,nm$ , radiation belongs to the **x-ray** regime. 
 
 Radiation with wavelength of less than $1\times10^{-4}\,nm$ is called **gamma** rays.
