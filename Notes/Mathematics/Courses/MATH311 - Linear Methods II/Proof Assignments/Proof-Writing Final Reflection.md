**Note:** while not particularly substantive, I couldn't find anything to comment on in the proof (which was very well done) and this was one of the only ones that did not yet have a reply.

### Reflection:


MATH311 has been my first foray into the world of proofs - I haven't yet taken the introductory course in discrete math, so I was slightly nervous about the more abstract, logical thinking required for these proof-writing assignments. Now that the 5 proofs are written and the course is nearly over, I can safely conclude that these exercises have helped me to become a more complete mathematician. The most interesting thing about these proof-writing assignments to me is the aspect of peer-review included in them. In my opinion, the fact that proofs were uploaded publicly to D2L and constructive criticism from peers was encouraged provided value in two ways. 

The first way has to do with the writing and posting of the proofs: since the proof was written with the knowledge that it would be uploaded publicly, I started writing 'defensively', *i.e.* trying to look at my work from the perspective of someone who will be trying to critique it. This is excellent training for future work, and I expect it is a crucial skill when trying to publish any original work. By keeping that defensive perspective, I was naturally more inclined to search for holes in my logic, or places in which my argument was unclear. 

The second source of value comes from the other side - that of the one providing commentary. Much like how the format of the assignments encouraged defensive writing, the part where we commented on other's proofs gave us experience with evaluating the logic of a mathematical proof. On the one hand, we got practice looking for the various forms of logical errors we learned about in the Error Classification guide - improper assertions, false implications, incorrect usage of theorems, and others. Sometimes these were immediately evident, but other times some deeper analysis was required. 

On the other hand, we were also advised to provide positive feedback. This was not just an exercise in softening the blow of constructive criticism, in vein of the 'complement sandwich' idea - the process of searching for things our peers did well helped us gain competency in identifying successful proof strategies, styles, and techniques, which we could then attempt to replicate in our own work. 

While at times, trying to make sure the proofs were 'bulletproof' before posting was stressful, overall the experience was a very beneficial one. I received some valuable feedback from several of my peers that I was able to incorporate into my next proof, and now, near the end of the class, I'm nowhere near as nervous about the writing and reviewing of proofs as I was at the beginning of the term. While I do think that the experience of having taken the discrete math course would have been beneficial, I no longer feel as though I'm missing the foundation for this type of work. 

The feedback from other students also highlighted an area where I can improve any proofs I may write in the future. The defensive style of writing occasionally resulted in a very overwritten proof - I got so caught up in making sure that every possible objection was accounted for that I ended up turning a half-page proof into a five page one. This ended up hurting more than helping - while anticipating critiques prior to receiving them can be helpful, it's often not worth sacrificing simplicity or brevity for the sake of being completely thorough.	

In a general sense, this overwriting was the biggest area of potential improvement for the proofs I completed over the course of this semester. Not only in the case mentioned above, where I attempted to predict all possible critiques, but also in the basic structure of the proof itself. In several of my proof-writing assignments, I included a number of extraneous details that, while true, did not meaningfully contribute to proving the desired claim for that assignment. In future exercises, I will strive to pare down my proofs such that they only include the assumptions, facts, and implications that are directly in service of proving the given claim. 

Another challenge I encountered had less to do with the assignments themselves, and more to do with the D2L platform and the structure of the discussion post. As mentioned above, there was an instance in which I thought that I had successfully completed two responses for a certain topic, when in fact I had not - I didn't realize until fairly late in the semester that it was possible to 'search' a given topic thread for your own name, returning any submissions and comment replies you posted on that particular thread. This problem was the result of disorganization on my end during a busy semester, but luckily it led to an improved understanding of the D2L platform, and I will be more prepared in future courses to keep track of what has and has not been posted in a certain thread. 

Thank you for these assignments! I found them very productive and useful.
