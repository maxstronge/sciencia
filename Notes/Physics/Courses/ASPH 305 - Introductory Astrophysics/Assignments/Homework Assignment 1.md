1. Astronomers on Earth have measured the distance to a hypothetical approaching asteroid to be $0.713\,AU$. 

- *(a)* If the observed angular diameter of the asteroid at the time of observation is $0.01''$, **calculate the physical diameter (in *m*) and the solid angle (in *sr*)**. For the physical diameter, use both the *small angle approximation* **AND** the *full trigonometric approach* to confirm whether or not the small angle approximation is valid. **Explain your reasoning**. 


> Assuming the asteroid can be approximated as a sphere. 
> - distance $d = 0.713\,AU = 1.06663 \times 10^{8}\,km$
> - angular diameter $\alpha = 0.01'' = 4.84814 \times 10^{-8}\,rad$

With small-angle approximation: physical diameter $D = d \alpha:$

$$\begin{align} D & = d \alpha \\ & = (1.06663 \times 10^{8})\,(4.84814 \times 10^{-8}) \\ &=5.17118 \,km.\end{align} $$
