The centripetal force for the orbiting electron is $F_c = \frac{m  v^2}{r}$.

For the electron:
- $m_e = 9.109\times10^{-31}\text{ kg}$
- $r = a_0 = 5.29\times10^{-11}\text{ m}$
- $q = -e\text{ C}$ (equal/opposite to proton)

The centripetal force $F_c$ is the Coulomb force, given by:

$$F_c = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{a_0^2}$$

where the force is directed radially inwards towards the nucleus. We can equate this to the centripetal force above:

$$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{a_0^2} = \frac{m_ev_e^2}{a_0}$$

....which, after rearranging and canceling a factor of the Bohr radius, gives the following expression for the velocity:

>$$v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0 }\frac{e^2}{a_0 m}} = 2.1876\times10^6\text{ m/s.}$$

We can thus find the kinetic energy of the electron:

>$$\begin{align}\text{K} &= \frac{1}{2} \ m_e  v_e^2 \\[2ex] &= \frac{1}{2}(9.109\times10^{-31})(2.1876\times10^6)^2 \\[2ex] &= 2.17987\times10^{-18}\text{ J} \\ &= 13.6 \text{ eV}.  \end{align}$$

This matches the Bohr model's prediction for the electron in a hydrogen atom for $n=1$, so the result is reasonable.

#### a)

Let $\kappa = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}$.

The two charges on the $x$-axis will balance and cancel out, leaving only the two opposite charges on the $y$-axis to contribute to the net electric field (and hence the electric force experienced by the charge at the origin).

The bottom charge has charge $+q$, and is located at position $\left<0,  -l   \right>$. The distance $\va{r}$ between that charge and the probe charge at the origin is thus $\va{r} = \left< 0,0\right> - \left< 0,-l   \right> = \left< 0,l \right> \implies |\va{r}| = \sqrt{0+l^2} = l.$

The direction of the electric field will be determined by $\vu{r}$, which can be found by:

$$\vu{r} = \frac{\va{r}}{|\va{r}|} = \frac{\left<0,l \right>}{l} = \left<0,1 \right> = \vu{y}$$

Since the bottom charge is positive, the electric field due to the positive charge will point upwards in the positive $y$ direction, and the magnitude of the field is given by:

$$E_{\text{ bottom}} = \kappa \frac{q}{|\va{r}|^2} = \kappa \frac{q}{l^2}.$$

Thus the electric field of the bottom charge is:

$$\va{E}_{\text{ bottom}} = \kappa \frac{q}{l^2} \ \vu{y}.$$

Following an identical process for the top charge (which is negative), we find the distance $\va{r}$ to be $\left< 0,-l\right> \implies |\va{r}| = l$. 

Finding the direction vector $\vu{r}$:
$$\vu{r} = \frac{\va{r}}{|\va{r}|} = \frac{\left< 0,-l\right>}{l} = \left<0,-1\right> = -\vu{y}.$$

Because the charge is negative, though, the electric field will point in the positive $y$-direction (towards the negative charge). Thus:



$$\begin{align} \va{E}_{\text{ top}} &= \kappa \frac{-q}{l^2} \ (-\vu{y}) \\ &= \kappa \frac{q}{l^2} \vu{y}. \end{align}$$

Therefore the net electric field is $\va{E}_{\text{net}} = \va{E}_{\text{ bottom}} +\va{E}_{\text{ top}} = 2\kappa\frac{q}{l^2} \ \vu{y}$. Because the charge at the observation location is positive, the electric force experienced by this charge will point in the same direction as the field ($+\vu{y}$).

#### b)

The net electric field found in the previous question is $\left< 0, 2\kappa \frac{q}{l^2}\right>$. We want to rotate the direction of this field (and thus the force) $45\degree$ clockwise, corresponding to a rotation by $-45\degree = -\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians. 

Since the charges on the $y$-axis remain unchanged, the $y$-component of the net electric field remains the same. From the figure, we can conclude that the new $x$-component of the net electric field is the same as the $y$-component (since the triangle is $45\degree$):

$$\va{E}_\text{new} = \left< 2\kappa \frac{q}{l^2}\, , \, 2\kappa \frac{q}{l^2}\right>$$

The $x$-component of the field is the vector sum of the electric fields due to the two charges on the $x$-axis. We can utilize this fact to find the magnitude of charge $Q$:

$$\begin{align}E_x = 2\kappa \frac{q}{l^2} &= \va{E}_\text{ left} + \va{E}_Q \\2\kappa\frac{q}{l^2} &= \kappa \frac{q}{l^2} + \kappa \frac{Q}{l^2} \\[2ex] 2q &=  q + Q \\[2ex] |q| &= |Q| \end{align}$$

The magnitude of the charges are the same - since the force is unbalanced and the x-component is in the positive $x$-direction, the charge $Q$ must be negative:

>$$Q=-q.$$

#### 9. 

In the depicted situation, the spring force according to Hooke's Law is balanced by the electrostatic repulsion between the two positive charges. Letting $\kappa$ again stand for $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$:

> $$\begin{align}\va{F}_\text{spring} &= \va{F}_\text{Coulomb} \\[2ex] -k \ d &= \kappa\frac{q^2}{d^2} \\[2ex] \kappa \ q^2 &= -k  \ d^3 \\[2ex] d^3 &= \frac{-(\kappa \ q^2)}{k} \\[2ex] d^3 &= \frac{(-q^2)}{4\pi\epsilon_0 k } \\[2ex]d &= \root 3 \of {\frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 k}} \end{align}$$

...where in the last step the negative sign was omitted, since $q^2$ will always be positive. 

#### 10. 
Since the charge on the right is stronger than the charge on the left, the point at which the fields due to  the two charges are balanced will be closer to the left charge than the right charge (in the range $(-d,d)$). 

Let the left charge be charge A, and the right charge be charge B. Let the distance between charge A and the zero point be $s$ - then, the distance between charge B and the zero point is $2d - s.$

For the electric fields due to A and B to balance, they must be equal in magnitude:

$$|\va{E}_A| -  |\va{E}_B| = 0 $$

Letting $\kk = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}$:

$$\begin{align}\kk\frac{q}{s^2}  -\kk \frac{2q}{(2d-s)^2}&= 0 \\[2ex] \frac{1}{s^2} =\frac{2}{(2d-s)^2} \\[2ex] (2d-s)^2  = 2s^2 \\[2ex] -2s^2+4d^2- 4ds+s^2 = 0 \\ s^2+4ds-4d^2 = 0\end{align}$$

Solving the above with the quadratic formula, we are left with:

$$s=-2(1\pm\sqrt{2})d$$

Since we know the zero-point should be somewhere between A and the origin, we take the result that fits within that range:

$$s= 2(1-\sqrt{2})d = 0.828d$$

Since $s$ is the distance between A and the point we're looking for, the zero point is $0-(1-s)$:

$$s-d = 0.828d - d$$
