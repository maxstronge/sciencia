Einstein’s special theory of relativity and Planck’s quantum theory burst forth on the physics scene almost simultaneously during the first decade of *C20*. Both theories caused profound changes in the way we view our universe at its most fundamental level.

In this chapter, we study the special theory of relativity. This theory has a completely undeserved reputation as being so exotic that few people can understand it - on the contrary, special relativity is basically a system of kinematics and dynamics, based on a set of postulates that are different from those of classical physics. The resulting formalism is not much more complicated than Newton’s laws, but it does lead to several predictions that seem to go against our common sense. Even so, the special theory of relativity has been carefully and thoroughly tested by experiment and found to be correct in all its predictions.

We first review the classical relativity of Galileo and Newton, and then we show why Einstein proposed to replace it. We then discuss the mathematical aspects of special relativity, the predictions of the theory, and finally some experimental tests.

## Key Equations:

##### ** The Lorentz Transformation:**

>$$\LARGE\begin{align}
 x' & = \frac{x-ut}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} = \gamma(x-ut) .\\
y' & = y .\\
z' & = z .\\
t' & = \frac{t-(u/c^2)x}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} = \gamma \;(t-(u/c^2)\,x)  .\\
\end{align}$$

##### **Length Contraction:**
> ## $$L_0 = \gamma L,\quad \text{or,} \quad L = L_0 \frac{1}{\gamma}.$$

##### ** Time Dilation:**

> ## $$\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t. $$
