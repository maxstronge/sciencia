# 9.1 - Acceleration without Rotation: 
***

Let us consider an inertial frame $\mathbb S_0$ and a second frame $\mathbb S$ that is *accelerating relative to* $\mathbb S_0$ with an acceleration *A*, which need not necessarily be constant. We're really interested in the noninertial frame here, which is why we've called it $\mathbb S$ in this case. The inertial frame $\mathbb S_0$ could be some stationary frame attached to the ground. $\mathbb{S_0}$ could be a frame anchored to a railway car moving relative to $\mathbb{S}$ with velocity *V* and acceleration $A = \dot V$. Suppose now that a passenger in the car is playing catch with a tennis ball of mass *m*, and let us consider the motion of this ball, first as measured relative to $\mathbb{S_0}$. Because $\mathbb{S_0}$ is **inertial**, we know that Newton's second law holds, so:

> ## $$m \ddot r_0 = F$$
> ...where $r_0$ is the ball's position relative to $\mathbb{S_0}$ and $F$ is the net force on the ball.

Now consider the same ball's motion as measured relative to the accelerating frame $\mathbb{S}$. The ball's position relative $\mathbb{S}$ is *r*, and, by the **Galilean vector-addition of velocities**, it's velocity $\dot r$ relative to $\mathbb{S}$ is related to $\dot r_0$ by:

> ## $$\dot r_0 = \dot r + V. $$ 

That is, the ball's velocity *relative to the ground* is equal to the ball's velocity *relative to the car*, plus the *car's velocity relative to the ground.*

Differentiating and rearranging this expression we find that:

> ## $$\ddot r = \ddot r_0 -A.$$

Multiplying this expression by *m* and using [[9.1 - Acceleration without Rotation#^9b74be|the above relation to subsitute]]:

> ## $$m \ddot r = F - mA. $$

This equation has exactly the form of Newton's second law, *except* that in addition to *F*  (the sum of all forces identified in the inertial frame), there is an extra term on the right equal to $mA$. This means we can continue to use Newton's second law in the noninertial frame *provided* that we agree that in the noninertial frame we must add an extra *force-like* term, often called the **inertial force**.

> ## $$ F^{inertial} = -mA.$$


One can take the view that the inertial force is a "fictitious force", introduced merely to preserve the form of Newton's second law in the noninertial frame - but for observers in that frame (such as passengers in a car taking a steep turn, feeling 'pushed outwards') the inertial force is entirely real.
