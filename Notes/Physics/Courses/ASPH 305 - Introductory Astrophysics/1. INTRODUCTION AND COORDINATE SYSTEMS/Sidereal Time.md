# Sidereal Time: 

***

> **Sidereal** = "of / pertaining to the stars". 


The Earth rotates one complete revolution (*i.e.* $360\degree$) every 23*h* 56*min* 4*s* *relative to the stars*. This is called a **sidereal day**.

A **solar day** (exactly 24*h* measured from noon to noon) thus actually corresponds to a slight over-rotation of the Earth ($>360\degree$).

When working in solar time, the rising/setting times of stars will vary with time - *e.g.* if a star rises tonight at 11:00 PM, then tomorrow it will rise at 10:56 PM, and the day after at 10:52 PM. This is very inconvenient for astronomers, so a new time system was developed - a **sidereal time** measured relative to more distant stars than Sol. In sidereal time, each star will always rise at the same time each night. 

Sidereal time avoids the problem of relative time, but the sidereal time will be different for observers at different *longitudes*, as people at different longitudes will see different stars on their respective *meridian*. 

The **Local Sidereal Time** (LST) is the *hour angle* (HA) of the **vernal equinox**. 

It can also be found according to the following relations:

> ## $$LST = HA_{\text{of object}} + RA_{\text{of same object}}. $$
or....
> ## $$LST = RA_{\text{meridian}}. $$

The stars are (for the most part) fixed with respect to one another. On a daily basis, we observe celestial bodies (stars, moons, planets, etc.) moving from East to West as the Earth rotates. This is called **diurnal / daily motion**. 

But over time, Sol, Luna, and the other planets in our solar system move *West to East* with respect to the *fixed stars*. This is **direct motion**. Direct motion is most apparent with Luna, which moves about $12\degree$ each day, resulting in it rising 50 minutes later each successive day. Sol and the planets move much more slowly.
