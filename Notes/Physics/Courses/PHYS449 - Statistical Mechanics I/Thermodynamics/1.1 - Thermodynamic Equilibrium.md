# 1.1 - Thermodynamic Equilibrium:
**LO**: Explain concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamic coordinates, and quasi-static changes for macroscopic physical systems. 

***
- *Temperature* = what you measure with a thermometer (for now)
- Definition of temperature is *operational* definition, i.e. defined in terms of how you measure
- Thermometers rely on the fact that if two systems/objects are in contact with each other, they will eventually come to the same temperature - thus temperature is the thing that's the same when two objects are in contact long enough. This is a *theoretical* definition, but still needs a lot of work obviously
- After two objects are in contact long enough, they come to **thermodynamic equilibrium**, and the time taken to reach that equilibrium is called the **relaxation time**.
- What do we mean by contact? $\implies$ two objects exchange energy spontaneously in the form of heat (this can be mechanical or radiation transfer)
- We can restate the theoretical definition of temperature:

> **Temperature** is the tendency of an object to spontaneously give up energy to its surroundings. When two objects are in thermal contact, the one that tends to spontaneously *lose* energy is at a higher temperature.

Example problem:

When the temperature of liquid mercury increases by one degree Celsius (or by one Kelvin), it's volume increases by one part in 5500. The *fractional increase in volume per unit change in temperature* (with pressure held fixed) is called the **thermal expansion coefficient**, $\bb$:


$$\bb \equiv \frac{\DD V/V}{\DD T}$$

...where $V$ is volume, $T$ Temperature, and $\DD$ is a change, which should be infinitesimal if $\bb$ is to be well-defined.

Thus for mercury, $\bb=\frac{1}{5500}\text{ K}^{-1}.$



For a solid, we also define the **linear thermal expansion coefficient**, $\aa$, as the fractional increase in length per degree:

$$\aa \equiv \frac{\DD L/L}{\DD T}$$
