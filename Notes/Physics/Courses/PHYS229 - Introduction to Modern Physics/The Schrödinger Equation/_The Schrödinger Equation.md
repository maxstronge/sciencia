The future behavior of a particle in a *classical* (nonrelativistic, non-quantum) situation may be predicted with *absolute certainty* using Newton's Laws. If a particle interacts with its environment through a force *F* (which may have a corresponding potential energy *U* ), we can do the mathematics necessary to solve Newton's second law, $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$ (a second-order linear differential equation) and find the particles *location* $\vec r(t)$ and velocity $\vec v(t)$ at all future times *t*. The mathematics may be difficult, and may require a numerical solution with the aid of a computer, but that's all there is to it. 

In the case of nonrelativistic quantum physics, the analogous basic equation to be solved is a second-order differential equation called the **Schrödinger equation**. Like Newton's laws, the Schrödinger equation is written for a *particle interacting with its environment*, though we describe the interaction in terms of a potential energy *U* rather than a force. Unlike Newton's laws, the Schrödinger equation does not yield the trajectory/equations of motion for a particle; instead, its solutions give the **wave function** of a particle, which carries information about the particle's *wavelike behavior*. In this chapter, we introduce the Schrödinger equation, obtain some of its solutions for certain potential energies, and learn to interpret those solutions.
