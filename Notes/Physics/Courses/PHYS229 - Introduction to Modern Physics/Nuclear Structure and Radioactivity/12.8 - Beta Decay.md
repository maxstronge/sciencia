# 12.8 - Beta Decay:

***

In **beta decay**, a neutron in the nucleus changes into a proton, or a proton changes into a neutron. *Z* and *A* both change by 1 unit, but *A* remains constant. 

The emitted particles (first called **"beta particles"** when observed initially in 1898) were soon identified as electrons. In the most basic beta decay process, a *free neutron* decays into a *proton* and an *electron*:

> ## $$n \to p + e^- .$$

A third particle is also produced, which we will discuss later. 

The emitted electron is *not* one of the orbital electrons of the atom! In fact, the electron was not previously present in the nucleus at all, because as we've mentioned, the uncertainty principle forbids electron to be located within the nucelus (the confinement of the electron's location would result in an unreasonable kinetic energy). The electron is **manufactured** by the nucleus out of the available energy. If the rest energy *difference* between the the nuclei is at least $m_ec^2$, this will be possible. 

In early *C20*, beta decay experiments revealed two difficulties. First, the decay $n \to p + e^-$ appears to violate the law of conservation of angular momentum, as discussed [[12.6 - Radioactive Decay#^928114|here]]. Second, measurements of the energy of the emitted electrons showed that the energy spectrum of the electrons is **continuous**, from zero up to some maximum value $K_{max}$, as shown in the figure.

This implies an apparent violation of conservation of energy, because all electrons should emerge from the decay $n \to p + e^-$ should emerge with exactly the same energy. Instead, all electrons emerge with less energy than they should, but in varying amounts. 

For example, in the decay $n \to p + e^-$, the *Q* value is:


> ## $$Q = (m_n - m_p - m_e)\,c^2 = 0.782\;MeV. $$

Except fora very small correction which accounts for the **recoil energy** of the proton, all of this energy *should* appear as kinetic energy of the electron, and all emitted electrons should have *exactly* this energy. However, experiments in the *1920s$_{CE}$* showed that all the emitted electrons have less than this energy - they have a continuous range of energies from $0$ to $0.782\,MeV$.

The problem of this 'missing' energy went unsolved for some time until $1930_{CE}$ when **Wolfgang Pauli** found an ingenious solution to *both* the apparent violations of conservation of angular momentum and energy - he suggested that there is a *third* particle emitted in beta decay. 

Electric charge is already conserved by the proton and the electron, so this new particle *cannot have electric charge*. To conserve angular momentum, it will need to have **spin** $\frac{1}{2}$, because the combined spins of the three decay particles gives $\frac{1}{2}$, which matches the spin of the initial decaying neutron. The missing energy is the energy carried away by this particle, and the observed fact that the energy spectrum ranges all the way to $0.782\;MeV$ suggests that this particle has a very small mass.

This new particle is called the **neutrino** (from the Italian for "*little neutral one*"), and has the symbol $\nu$. Every particle turns out to have an **antiparticle**, and the antiparticle of the neutrino is the **antineutrino**, $\bar \nu$. It is, in fact, this antineutrino that is emitted in neutron beta decay. The complete decay process is thus:

> ## $$n \to p + e^- + \overline \nu. $$


Neutron decay can also occur in a nucleus, in which a nucleus with *Z* protons and *N* neutrons decays to a nucleus with $Z+1$ protons and $N-1$ neutrons:

> ## $$^A_ZX_N\to ^A_{Z+1}X'_{N-1} + e^- + \overline \nu. $$

The *Q* value for this decay is:

> ## $$Q = [m(^AX)-m(^AX')]\;c^2 .$$ 

Again, the electron masses will cancel in calculating *Q*, so it is atomic masses that appear in the above expression. The antineutrino does not appear in the calculation of the *Q* value because its mass is negligibly small (of the order ~$eV/c^2$, compared with the atomic masses measured in units ~$10^3\,MeV/c^2$).

The energy released in the decay (the *Q* value) appears as the energy $E_{\bar \nu}$ of the antineutrino, the kinetic energy $K_e$ of the electron, and a small, usually negligible recoil kinetic energy of the nucleus $X'$:

> ## $$Q = E_{\bar \nu}+K_e+K_X' \cong E_{\bar \nu} + K_e. $$

The electron, which must be treated **relativistically**, because its kinetic energy is *not* small compared with its rest energy, has its maximum kinetic energy when the antineutrino has a negligibly small energy. The electron and antineutrino share the decay energy *Q*; the kinetic energy of the electron (equal to $Q-E_{\bar \nu}$) ranges from *0* (when the antineutrino has its maximum energy, $E_{\bar \nu} = Q$) to *Q* (when $E_{\bar \nu} = 0$).

Another beta decay process is **proton beta decay**:


> ## $$p \to n + e^+ +\nu. $$

In this process, a *positive electron*, called a **positron**, is emitted. The positron is the antiparticle of the electron: it has the *same mass* as an electron, but the *opposite charge* (equal to that of a proton). The neutrino emitted in this process is, similarly, the antiparticle of the antineutrino that is emitted in neutron beta decay. 

Proton beta decay has a *negative Q* value, and so it is never observed in nature for free protons (luckily, or else stable hydrogen could not exist and the universe would be quite boring). However, protons in certain nuclei can undergo this decay process:

> ## $$^A_ZX_N\to ^A_{Z+1}X'_{N-1}+e^++\nu. $$ 

The *Q* value for this process is:

> ## $$Q = [m(^AX)-m(^AX')-2m_e]\;c^2 $$

...in which the masses are *atomic masses*. In this case, the positron and the neutrino share the decay energy *Q* (again, neglecting the small recoil energy of the nucleus *X'*).

Another nuclear decay process that competes with positron emission is **electron capture**; the basic electron capture process is:


> ## $$p + e^- \to n + \nu $$

...in which a proton captures an atomic electron from its orbit, and converts into a neutron, emitting a neutrino. 

The electron necessary for this process is one of the inner orbital electrons in an atom, and we identify the capture process by the shell from which the captured electrons come: they can be called ***K*-shell capture**, ***L*-shell capture**, and so on. The **electronic orbits** that come closest to (or sometimes even penetrate) the nucleus clearly have the highest probability to be captured. 

In nuclei, the process is:

> ## $$^A_ZX_N + e^- \to _{Z-1}^AX'_{N+1} + \nu $$

..and the *Q* value, using atomic masses, is:

> ## $$Q = [m(^AX)-m(^AX')]\;c^2. $$

In this case, neglecting the small initial kinetic energy of the electron and the recoil energy of the nucleus, the neutrino takes *all* of the available final energy:

> ## $$E_\nu = Q. $$

In contrast to other beta-decay processes, a **monoenergetic neutron** is emitted in electron capture.
