# Linear Transformations:

***

If *V* and *W* are vector spaces, such as $\Rii$ or $\Riii$, a function $T:V \to W$ is a rule that assigns to each vector $\vec{v}$ in *V* a uniquely determined vector $T(\vec{v})$ in *W*. 

As mentioned previously, two functions $S:V\to W$ and $T:V \to W$ are equal if $S(v) = T (v) \, \forall\,v \text{ in }V.$



We have already studied elsewhere linear transformations of the form $T: \Rn \to \Rm$, and demonstrated that they are all given by multiplication by a uniquely determined $\mxn$ matrix $A$; that is, $T(x) = A(x)$ for all $x$ in $\Rn$. 

In the case of linear operators $\Rii \to \Rii$, this yields an important way describe geometric functions such as rotations about the origin and reflections in a line through the origin. 

In the present chapter, we will describe linear transformations in general, introduce the **image** and the **kernel** of a transformation, and prove a useful result (called the **Dimension theorem**) that relates the dimensions of the kernel and image, unifying and extending earlier results. Finally, we will study the notion of *isomorphic vector spaces*, that is, spaces that are identical except for notation, and relate this to the composition of transformations introduced in introductory linear algebra.
