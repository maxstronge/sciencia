Notes on Emmanual Haven and Andrei Khrennikov

- specialization makes it difficult to be both the developer and the tester of a theory
- dedicated to the application of quantum-mechanical models and ideas to the macroscopic world of social interaction - this needs justification
- in their approach: *the quantum-like behavior of human beings is **not** a consequence of quantum physical processes in the brain* (though that may indeed be occurring and may even be the mechanism)

- econophysics - mainly composed of physicists interested in explicitly using physics techniques in social sciences (not only economics/finance - has been done for sociology/religious studies)
- eg. finding power laws in economic data
- central questions: how can we model *information* to a reasonable standard in a social science setting? Anton Zeilinger has an information-only formulation of qm
