# Commentary on Electromagnetic Waves:
***
Two aspects of electromagnetic waves are important to emphasize - first, the *frequency* of an electromagnetic wave spans an enormous range. At the lower end, $50$-$60$ Hz waves are used to transmit electric power, and towards the higher end, $10^{14}\text{ Hz}$ waves are associated with visible light, and X-rays/gamma rays at even higher frequencies.

The second is that, unlike mechanical/sound waves which can only propagate in some certain *medium*, electromagnetic waves can propagate in a vacuum. This was difficult for physicists to believe for a long long time (see the Michelson-Morley experiment and [[2.3 - Einstein's Postulates|Einstein's resulting postulates]] for the final nail in the coffin of the ether hypothesis.)


Consider a sound wave, in contrast. We have seen that the motion of the molecules about their equilibrium position determines the kinetic energy, and the displacement from equilibrium positions determines the potential energy associated with wave motion.  Conversely: in *any* media capable of storing kinetic and potential energies, mechanical waves can be produced and will propagate.

Close analogy can be found in a vacuum. Consider a capacitor first. A capacitor is a system that can store electrical energy within its volume. Although most capacitors are filled with [[Dielectrics and Polarization|dielectric materials]], this does not have to be the case. The dielectrics can be replaced with air or a vacuum - that is, *a vacuum can store electrical energy*. 

Next, take an **inductor**, which is capable of storing magnetic energy. Again, the magnetic energy is stored in the volume occupied by the inductor, which can be air or vacuum. Thus we draw an important conclusion: the vacuum is capable of storing electric and magnetic energies. This corresponds to the potential and kinetic energies [[Energy Tossing in Mechanical Oscillations||that were found in mechanical waves.]] So we have an analogue to the earlier statement about mechanical waves:

> In any media capable of storing both electric and magnetic energy, electromagnetic waves can be produced and will propagate. 

In an ideal vacuum, electromagnetic waves are completely **dispersionless** - i.e. the **phase velocity** equals the **group velocity** for any frequency:

$$\frac{\omega}{k}= \frac{d\oo}{dk} = c = 299,792,458\text{ m/s}.$$

The ramifications of this not being true would kill the radio industry, since FM signals would be received at different times with different frequencies.

In media other than vacuum, however, electromagnetic waves *can* be dispersive (i.e. the velocity of visible light in glass is slower than that of light in air, or vacuum). More importantly, the velocity of light in glass depends (albeit very slightly) on the *wave frequency* of the light - that is, electromagnetic waves are not dispersionless.
