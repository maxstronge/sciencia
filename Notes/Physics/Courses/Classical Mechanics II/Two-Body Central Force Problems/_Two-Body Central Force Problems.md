# Two-Body Central Force Problems:
***


In this chapter, we discuss the motion of two bodies, each of which exerts a *conservative, central force* on the other, but are subject to no other external forces. There are many examples of this problem: the two stars of a binary star system, the moon orbiting the Earth, the electron and proton in an atom, etc.
