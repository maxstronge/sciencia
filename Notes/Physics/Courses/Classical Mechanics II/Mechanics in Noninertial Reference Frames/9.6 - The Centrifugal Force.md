 	 	# 9.6 - The Centrifugal Force: 
***

The **centrifugal force** is given as:

> ## $$F_{cf} = m(\Omega \times r) \times \Omega.$$

The above figure shows an object at/near the surface of the Earth at colatitude $\theta$. The Earth's rotation carries the object around a circle of latitude, and the vector $\Omega \times r$ (which is just the velocity of this circular motion as seen from an inertial frame) is *tangent* to this circle. Thus $(\Omega \times r) \times \Omega$ points *radially outwards* from the axis of rotation in the direction of $\hat \rho$, the unit vector in the $\rho$ direction of **cylindrical polar coordinates**. The magnitude of $(\Omega \times r) \times \Omega$ is easily seen to be $\Omega^2r\sin(\theta) = \Omega^2\rho$. Thus:

> ## $$F_{cf} = m \Omega^2\rho\;  \hat \rho. $$

To summarize, from the perspective of observers rotating with the Earth, there is a centrifugal force that is radially outwards from the earth's axis with magnitude $m\Omega^2 \rho$. If we momentarily let $ v = \Omega \times r$ denote the velocity associated with the Earth's rotation (as observed from an inertial frame), then its magnitude is $v = \Omega \rho$, and the centrifugal force takes the familiar form of $mv^2/\rho$.

## Free-Fall Acceleration:

The free-fall acceleration that we call *g* is the initial acceleration, relative to the Earth, of an object that is released from rest in a vacuum near the Earth's surface. We see now that this is a surprisingly complicated idea!

The equation of motion (relative to the Earth) is:

> ## $$m\ddot r = F_{grav} + F_{cf} $$
> ...where $F_{cf}$ is defined as above, and the gravitational force $F_{grav}$ is given by...
> ## $$F_{grav} = - \frac{GMm}{R^2}\hat r = mg_0. $$

Here, *M* and *R* are the mass and radius of the Earth, and $\hat r$ denotes the unit vector that points radially outwards from *O*, the center of the Earth. The acceleration **$g_0$** is defined by the second equality, and could be called the **"true" acceleration due to gravity** - it is the acceleration we would observe if there were no centrifugal or Coriolis effects. 

We can now see that the initial acceleration of a freely-falling object is determined by an **effective force** which is the sum of two terms:

> ## $$F_{eff} = F_{grav} +F_{cf} = mg_0 + m\Omega^2R\sin(\theta)\;\hat \rho. $$

It is clear that the free-fall acceleration is, in general, *not equal* to the *true gravitational acceleration*, either in magnitude or direction. Specifically, dividing the above relation by *m*, we find that for the free-fall acceleration $g$ (which we could call the **effective gravitational acceleration**):

> ## $$g = g_0 + \Omega^2R\sin(\theta)\;\hat \rho. $$

The component of *g* in the *inward radial direction*(the direction of $-\hat r$) is:

> ## $$g_{rad} = g_0 - \Omega^2R\sin^2(\theta). $$

The second *centrifugal* term in the above varies in strength - it is zero at the *poles*, where $\theta = 0\, \text{or} \,\pi$, and is largest at the equator. 

We can therefore see that the tangential component of *g* comes entirely from the centrifugal force, and is:

> ## $$g_{tang} = \Omega^2R\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta). $$

This tangential component is zero at the poles *and at the equator*, and is largest at latitude $45^{\circ}$.
