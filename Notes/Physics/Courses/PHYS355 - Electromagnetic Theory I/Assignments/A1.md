The centripetal force for the orbiting electron is $F_c = \frac{m  v^2}{r}$.

For the electron:
- $m_e = 9.109\times10^{-31}\text{ kg}$
- $r = a_0 = 5.29\times10^{-11}\text{ m}$
- $q = -e\text{ C}$ (equal/opposite to proton)

The centripetal force $F_c$ is the Coulomb force, given by:

$$F_c = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{a_0^2}$$

where the force is directed radially inwards towards the nucleus. We can equate this to the centripetal force above:

$$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{a_0^2} = \frac{m_ev_e^2}{a_0}$$

....which, after rearranging and canceling a factor of the Bohr radius, gives the following expression for the velocity:

>$$v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0 }\frac{e^2}{a_0 m}} = 2.1876\times10^6\text{ m/s.}$$

We can thus find the kinetic energy of the electron:

>$$\begin{align}\text{K} &= \frac{1}{2} \ m_e  v_e^2 \\[2ex] &= \frac{1}{2}(9.109\times10^{-31})(2.1876\times10^6)^2 \\[2ex] &= 2.17987\times10^{-18}\text{ J} \\ &= 13.6 \text{ eV}.  \end{align}$$

This matches the Bohr model's prediction for the electron in a hydrogen atom for $n=1$, so the result is reasonable.

#### a)

Let $\kappa = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}$.

The two charges on the $x$-axis will balance and cancel out, leaving only the two opposite charges on the $y$-axis to contribute to the net electric field (and hence the electric force experienced by the charge at the origin).

The bottom charge has charge $+q$, and is located at position $\left<0,  -l   \right>$. The distance $\va{r}$ between that charge and the probe charge at the origin is thus $\va{r} = \left< 0,0\right> - \left< 0,-l   \right> = \left< 0,l \right> \implies |\va{r}| = \sqrt{0+l^2} = l.$

The direction of the electric field will be determined by $\vu{r}$, which can be found by:

$$\vu{r} = \frac{\va{r}}{|\va{r}|} = \frac{\left<0,l \right>}{l} = \left<0,1 \right> = \vu{y}$$

Since the bottom charge is positive, the electric field due to the positive charge will point upwards in the positive $y$ direction, and the magnitude of the field is given by:

$$E_{\text{ bottom}} = \kappa \frac{q}{|\va{r}|^2} = \kappa \frac{q}{l^2}.$$

Thus the electric field of the bottom charge is:

$$\va{E}_{\text{ bottom}} = \kappa \frac{q}{l^2} \ \vu{y}.$$

Following an identical process for the top charge (which is negative), we find the distance $\va{r}$ to be $\left< 0,-l\right> \implies |\va{r}| = l$. 

Finding the direction vector $\vu{r}$:
$$\vu{r} = \frac{\va{r}}{|\va{r}|} = \frac{\left< 0,-l\right>}{l} = \left<0,-1\right> = -\vu{y}.$$

Because the charge is negative, though, the electric field will point in the positive $y$-direction (towards the negative charge). Thus:



$$\begin{align} \va{E}_{\text{ top}} &= \kappa \frac{-q}{l^2} \ (-\vu{y}) \\ &= \kappa \frac{q}{l^2} \vu{y}. \end{align}$$

Therefore the net electric field is $\va{E}_{\text{net}} = \va{E}_{\text{ bottom}} +\va{E}_{\text{ top}} = 2\kappa\frac{q}{l^2} \ \vu{y}$. Because the charge at the observation location is positive, the electric force experienced by this charge will point in the same direction as the field ($+\vu{y}$).

#### b)

The net electric field found in the previous question is $\left< 0, 2\kappa \frac{q}{l^2}\right>$. We want to rotate this field (and thus the force) $45\degree$ clockwise, corresponding to a rotation by $-45\degree = -\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians. 

The transformation is as follows: if $E_\text{ initial} = \left<E_x,E_y\right>$ and $E_\text{ final} = \left<E_{x'},E_{y'}\right>$, then:

$$E_{x'} = E_x\cos{\tt}-E_y\sin{\tt}\qq{,}E_{y'}=E_x\sin{\tt}+E_y\cos{\tt}$$

Since the first term in each of these transformations is zero (because $E_x=0$), we're left with:
$$E_{x'} = -E_y\sin{\tt}\qq{,}E_{y'} = E_y\cos{\tt}.$$

Applying these transformations we find the new net electric field after the rotation:

$$\begin{align} E_\text{ final} = \left< E_{x'},E_{y'}\right> &= \left< -E_y\sin{\tt} \, , E_y\cos{\tt} \right> \\ &= \left<-(2\kappa\frac{q}{l^2})\sin\left(\frac{-\pi}{4}\right) \, , \, (2\kappa\frac{q}{l^2})\cos\left(\frac{-\pi}{4}\right)\right> \\ &= \left< -(2\kappa\frac{q}{l^2}(\frac{-\sqrt{2}}{2}))\ , \ (2\kappa\frac{q}{l^2})(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \right> \\ &= \left< \sqrt{2}\kappa\frac{q}{l^2} \ , \ \sqrt{2}\kappa \frac{q}{l^2}\right> \end{align}$$

The component we are concerned with is the $x$-component, since that is what is affected by the replacement of the charge on the right. The $x$-component  of the net electric field is the sum of the fields of the two charges on the $x$-axis:

$$\sqrt{2}\kappa \frac{q}{l^2} = \va{E}_\text{ left} + \va{E}_{\text{Q}} $$

The electric field due to the charge on the left is unchanged: $\va{E}_{\text{left}} = \kappa \frac{q}{l^2}$. If the electric field due to the new charge $Q$ is $\kappa \frac{Q}{l^2}$, then:

$$\begin{align} \sqrt{2}\kappa \frac{q}{l^2}&=\kappa \frac{q}{l^2}+\kappa \frac{Q}{l^2}  \\[2ex] \sqrt{2} q &= q + Q \\[2ex] Q &= q\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right) \approx0.41 q.\end{align}$$

This charge is weaker than the previous charge, but still positive, resulting in the deflection of the net electric field to the right.
