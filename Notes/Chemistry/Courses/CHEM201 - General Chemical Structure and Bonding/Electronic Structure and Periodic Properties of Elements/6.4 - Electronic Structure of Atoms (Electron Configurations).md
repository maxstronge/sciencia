# 6.4 - Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron Configurations):

***

Having introduced the basics of atomic structure and [[_The SchrÃ¶dinger Equation|quantum mechanics]], we can use our understanding of *quantum numbers* to determine how atomic orbitals relate to one another. This allows us to determine which orbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of the chemical properties of the atom.

### Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure:

The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the [[7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom|principal quantum number]], *n*, increases. In any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of **subshells** with different values of $\ell$ (the second quantum number, has to do with angular momentum) differ, so that the energy of the orbitals *increases* within a shell in this order:

> ### $$s < p < d < f.$$

The *1s* at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy (most stable / least reactive).  

*NOTE FOR NON-PHYS MAJORS: don't worry about what s, p, d, and f stand for. It doesn't really mean anything, they're just labels that we give to different quantum states. The different quantum numbers (don't worry about what they do either) can take on different values, $\pm1,2,0$, etc., and the different combinations of those get a label like s, p, d, or f, just so we don't have to go and say what all the numbers are every time. *

The energy increases as we move up to the *2s*, *2p*, *3s*, and *3p* levels - notice that the increasing *n* value has more impact on the energy than the increasing $\ell$ value, at least for small atoms. This pattern does not hold for larger atoms, though (notice that the *4s* orbital is lower in energy than the *3d* orbital, so it comes first). 

You will note that the energy levels of the electrons are **quantized** - they can't take on any value, but they can only take on certain discrete values. This is the basis of quantum theory, and is all the word 'quantum' means - discrete, not continuous.

Successive atoms on the periodic table fill up these shells **in order**, according to the diagram above.
