The Milky Way galaxy is a **spiral disk** galaxy - it is relatively flat and roughly circular. Our solar system is roughly two-thirds of the way from the center of one of the **arms** of the Milky Way galaxy. 

Different wavelengths are needed to study different phenomena/aspects of the universe:

Pictured above is the Milky Way galaxy using Gamma rays - this is helpful for very high-energy phenomena such as black holes, neutron stars, hypernovae, etc. For some phenomena, such as black holes, gamma ray observation is necessary, as they do not emit visible light.


Slightly lower-energy phenomena are best observed with **X-Rays**:

Eg. white dwarves, supernovae remnants, etc.

UV light is a common wavelength for many phenomena such as novae, supernovae, star clusters, galaxies, and quasars.

Many stars in our galaxy are partially obscured by **interstellar dust**. Without this dust, the center of the galaxy would be visibly brighter than the full moon at night. Nevertheless, optical light is very frequently used in astronomical observations:

To avoid obscuration by dust, infrared radiation is often used:

This allows us to see much further since infrared radiation penetrates the dust that obscures visible light. Further = much older stars visible. 

At even longer wavelengths (FIR) the dust is emphasized, rather than ignored, since it is now an emitter:

And at a wavelength of 21cm, we can look at atomic hydrogen gas, the matter from which stars are made:

A very bright stripe of dense hydrogen gas is seen lining the center of the spiral arm. 

Radio waves, on the other hand, can pick up ionized gas and even magnetic fields ($\lambda$ = 74cm):
