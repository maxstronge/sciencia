# Line Integrals of Vector Fields:

***

For the next several sections, we will focus our attention more specifically on the origin of the functions we seek to integrate. 

Recall: 

$$\va{r}: [a,b] \to \Rn,\,H = \va{r}([a,b]).$$

Consider a function $f: \Rn \to \RR.$ Such a function can be integrated in the following way:


### $$\int_{H}f(\va{x})ds = \int_a^b f(\va{r}(t))\,\|\va{r}(t)\|dt.$$

Our focus here is on the function $f(\va{x})$, and the set of such functions that produce interesting results.

### Nonconstant $\va{F}$:

Recall [[Vector Fields]]. 

Consider a function $\va{F}(\va{x})$ that represents something like a force acting on a particle with position $\va{x}$. 

The work done by $\va{F}$ in moving a particle from position $\va{r}(t)$ to $\va{r}(t)$
