On the basis of this data, the solar model depicted in the figure bbelow has been derived:

The Sun is effectively an enormous ball of *fusing gas*, primarily composed of hydrogen ($\text{H}$) and helium ($\text{He}$). Hydrogen makes up approximately $91\%$ of the Sun's mass, helium ~$8\%$, and the small remainder various other products/metals. 

The temperature on the 'surface' of the Sun (though as we shall see, that term is a little misleading) ranges from about $2000\degree \text{- }50,000\degree\text{K}$, with an average temperature of about $5800\text{ K}$. In the core, the temperature can spike to millions of degrees Kelvin. 

The Sun produces energy at the rate of $4\times10^{26}\text{ W}$, which is equivalent to changing about $4$ million tonnes of mass to energy, or the detonation of $100$ trillion nuclear weapons per second. This energy is produced by the *p-p* chain in a small central region - in fact, $99\%$ of solar energy is produced within a quarter of the solar radius.
