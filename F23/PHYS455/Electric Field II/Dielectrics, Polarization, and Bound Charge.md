As we investigate the ways in which the properties of matter constrain the electric field, we divide matter broadly speaking into two categories - conductors and dielectrics (i.e. insulators). 

Charge is not free to move in a dielectric like it is in a conductor. In an applied electric field, however, negative charge is 'pulled' towards the source of the field, creating induced dipoles. 

In small volume elements $d \tau$ of the matter of a dielectric, there will be a large number of dipoles, and we can associate a **dipole moment** $\vec{p}$ with the volume element that is the sum of all the moments of the individual atomic constituents within $d\tau$. 

Since we want $d\tau$ to be of variable size, and we want to understand the material in terms of *intensive* rather than *extensive* parameters, we define the **Polarization** to be the dipole moment per unit volume:

>$$
\vec{P} = \lim_{ d\tau \to 0 } \frac{\vec{p}}{d\tau}
$$

### Bound Charge

As charges move in response to an applied electric field, there will be regions of nonzero charge density (volume elements as well as surface regions). These charges are not free to move as in a conductor, but are instead *bound* to the dielectric, and as such this charge density is referred to as **bound charge**. 

The total charge density $\rho$ that we use in Gauss's Law is thus the sum of the bound charge density and the *free* charge density, or

$$
\rho = \rho_{f} + \rho_{b}
$$

To derive a formula for the bound charge density we need to use a model for the atomic dipoles that contribute to the polarization.
