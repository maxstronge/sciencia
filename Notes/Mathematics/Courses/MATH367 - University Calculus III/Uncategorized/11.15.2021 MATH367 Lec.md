Last classes we went thru [[Divergence Theorem]]

Main theorems of the course thus far: Green's Theorem, Divergence, Theorem, Stoke's Theorem [today]. 

We can put these three theorems into a *unifying framework* reliant on the concept of [[Line Integrals of Differential Forms#^096cde|differential forms]].

### Stoke's Theorem:

Relates a surface $S \in \Riii$ and the boundary curve $C$ defining the boundary of $S$, oriented compatibly with $\hat{N}$, a unit vector normal to $S$. 

> $$\int_C \va{F}\cdot \ d\va{r} = \iint_S (\curl \va{F}\cdot\hat{N}) \ dS.$$
	
	
The *LHS* leaves an ambiguity in the orientation of the normal vector (which way are we going around $C$?) that we must resolve before proceeding.

### Orienting Surfaces and Boundary Curves Compatibly:

The normal unit vector $\hat{N}$ 'is' / can define an orientation of the surface $S$.

**Example:**

Use Stokes' Theorem to evaluate $\int_{C} \va{F}\cdot d \va{r}$, where:

- $C$ is the curve of intersection of $$x^2+y^2=1 \qq{} 2x+2y+z=3$$
oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above (high on the positive $z$-axis).
- $\va{F} = \qty(y^3,\,x^3,\,-z^3).$

Normal vector $N=(2,2,1) \implies \hat{N} = (2/3, 2/3, 1/3).$
