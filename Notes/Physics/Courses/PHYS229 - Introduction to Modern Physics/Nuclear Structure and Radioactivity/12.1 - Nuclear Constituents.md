# 12.1 - Nuclear Constituents:
***
The work of Rutherford/Bohr/etc. in early C20 showed that the positive charge of an atom is confined to a very small region in the center of the atom (the **nucleus**). The nucleus in an atom of atomic number *Z* has a charge of +*Ze*, and represents 99% of the atomic mass. It was well known at the time that the masses of the atoms (measured in atomic mass units *u*) were very nearly integers - we call this integer *A* the **mass number**. It was therefore reasonable to assume that nuclei are composed of a number *A* of more fundamental units whose mass is very close to 1*u*. Because the only known particle with a mass close to 1*u* at the time was the proton (the nucleus of hydrogen, with mass 1.0073*u* and charge *e*), it was postulated that the nucleus of an atom of mass number *A* contained *A* protons. This ultimately turned out to be incorrect. 

Such a nucleus would have a charge of *Ae* rather than *Ze*; because *A > Z* or all atoms heavier than hydrogen, this model ends up giving too much positive charge to the nucleus. This difficulty was removed by the **proton-electron model**, in which it was postulated (again incorrectly) that the nucleus also contained (*A - Z*) electrons. Under these assumptions, the nuclear mass would be about *A* times the mass of the protons (because the mass of the electron is so small as to be negligible in comparison), and the nuclear electric charge would be *A*(+*e*) + (*A - Z*)(-*e*) = *Ze*, in agreement with experiment - but this model leads to several difficulties, the most troublesome of which involves the uncertainty principle. In order for the location of the electrons to be confined to the nucleus, they would need to have unreasonably large kinetic energies, on the order of ~19 MeV! 

Another serious problem concerns the total **intrinsic spin** of the nucleus. From measurements of the *very* small effect of the nuclear magnetic moment on atomic transitions (which is called **hyperfine splitting**), we know that the proton has an intrinsic spin of $\frac{1}{2}$, just like the electron. Consider an atom of **deuterium**, a hydrogen isotope ('heavy hydrogen'). It has a nuclear charge of *+e*, just like regular hydrogen, but has a mass number of 2 units, twice that of regular hydrogen. The proton-electron model would require that the deuterium *nucleus* contains two protons and one electron, giving a net mass of $\approx$ 2 units and a net charge of *e*. Each of these particles has a spin of $\frac{1}{2}$, and the rules of adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics would lead to a spin for deuterium of either $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{2}$, but experimental measurement shows that the total spin of deuterium is simply 1. For thse and other reasons, the hypothesis that electrons are a nuclear constituent must be discarded. 

The resolution to this problem came in 1932$_{CE}$ with the discovery of the **neutron**, a particle of roughly the same mass as the proton (actually, about 0.1% more massive), but having *no electric charge*. According to the **proton-neutron model**, a nucleus consists of *Z* protons and (*A - Z*) neutrons, giving a total charge of *Ze* and a total mass of ~*A* atomic units, consistent with experiment. 

The proton and neutron are almost identical (apart, obviously, from their electric charge) and so they are classified together as **nucleons**.

The chemical properties of any element depend on its atomic number *Z*, but *not* on its mass number *A*. It is possible to have two different nuclei with the same *Z* but a different mass number *A* (i.e. same number of protons, different number of neutrons). Atoms of these nuclei are identical in all of their chemical properties, differing only in their mass and other properties that depend on mass. Nuclei of this kind are called **isotopes**. Hydrogen, for example, has three isotopes, all of which have *Z* = 1: hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium, where *A* = 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 

When we discuss nuclear properties it becomes very important to distinguish among different isotopes: we do this by indicating, along with the chemical symbol, the atomic number *Z*, the mass number *A*, and the **neutron number** *N = A - Z* in the following format:

>## $$ _Z^A X_N$$

...where X is any chemical symbol. Since the chemical symbol and the atomic number *Z* give the same information, it's not necessary to include them both. Also, if we specify *Z*, we don't need to specify *both* *N* and *A* - usually, just the chemical symbol and *A* are sufficient.

For example, the three isotopes of hydrogen would be indicated as $_1^1H_0,\, _2^1H_1, \, and \;_3^1H_3,$ or, more compactly, $^1 H, \, ^2 H,$ and $^3 H.$
