# Parallax, Motion, and Distance:
***

The Ancient Greek philosopher/astronomer Hipparchus, who is partially credited with the invention of trigonometry, rejected the heliocentric model of the solar system because he could not observe **stellar parallax**, which is predicted by the theory.

**Parallax** is the apparent shift in position of a foreground object relative to other, more distant background objects. *E.g.* when you hold a thumb out at arms length and close one eye, then then other.

When taking measurements involving stellar parallax, to get the most accurate measurement one wants the *largest baseline* ($d\,$, *i.e.* distance between measurement points) possible. 

So to measure parallax, one needs to observe an object at two different times, preferably at maximum separation (*e.g.* on Earth, 6 months apart). This measurement, however, will be *twice* the **parallactic angle** ($p$) taken over *twice* the baseline, as in the figure below:

We can relate the parallactic angle $p$ to $D$ and $d$ as follows:


> ### $$\tan(p) = \frac{d}{D} \qq{or, for small angles,}p\,[\text{rads}] = \frac{d}{D}. $$


So if observations are made six months apart, the separation $d$ will be $2AU$, since the distance of the Earth from Sol remains roughly constant for calculations of this precision. How far away would a star have to be to have a parallactic angle of $p=0.5$?

For this $p$, we would measure $2p = 1'$, which is about the resolution of the human eye, so it's the best we can do unaided. The calculation proceeds as follows according to the above relation:

> ### $$\tan(p) = \frac{d}{D}\implies D = \frac{d}{\tan(p)} .$$
