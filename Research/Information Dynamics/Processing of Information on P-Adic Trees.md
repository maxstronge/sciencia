- Khrennikov does not follow Shannon's information theory - instead follows Bohm/Hiley's model - 'active' information rather than Shannon's passive info

Shorthand - we use $I$ to denote 'information', and $\tau$ to denote cognitive systems (such as human minds).

cognitive systems $\tau$ operate with $I$-strings - strings of information (in the abstract, can be digits, arbitrary symbols, letters of an alphabet). A given string of this type is called an $I$-state. 


Hierarchically coupled families of $I$-states form emergent $I$-objects that the authors refer to as **associations** - families of associations are **ideas**




The process of thinking is performed by a dynamical system that operates on these $I$-states, i.e. there is a nonlinear relation between input and output states:


$$
x_{n+1}=f(x_{n}),x_{n} \in X_{I}
$$

where $X_{I}$ is the configuration space of the dynamical system we are attempting to investigate, i.e. information space, the space of $I$-states.



Another basic feature of the model is Freud-inspired - separated into **conscious** and **unconscious** domains/regimes

Part of the conscious regime is a **Control Center**, $CC$

$x(t)=x_{0}e^{-(\gamma/2)t}\left[ \cos(\omega t )+\left( \frac{\gamma}{2\omega } \right)\sin(\omega t) \right]=x_{0}e^{-\left( \frac{\gamma}{2} \right)t}\cos(\omega_{0}t)$
