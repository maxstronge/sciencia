# 2.1 - Spherical Trigonometry: 

___

For the coordinate transformations of spherical astronomy, we need some mathematical tools, which we will present now. 

We need a coordinate system that will allow us to identify and locate points that essentially fall on the surface of a sphere (see [[COORDINATE SYSTEMS|the notes on the celestial sphere]]).

If a *plane* passes through the center of a sphere, as in the figure below, it will split the sphere into two identical *hemispheres* along a circle called a **great circle**. 

There are also **small circles**. Small circles are formed by the intersection of a plane with the sphere, like great circles, with the distinction that the plane of intersection does *not* go through the center of the sphere.

On Earth, we have a similar coordinate system used by geographers/geologists/etc. Lines of **longitude** are *great circles* that all converge at the northern and southern poles, and *small circles* form lines of **latitude** (except for the equator, which is a great circle). 


In spherical space, the shortest distance between any two points is not a straight line, as it is in flat Euclidean geometry - the shortest distance between any two points lies on a great circle. 

A line perpendicular to the plane passing through the center of the sphere will intersect the sphere at the **poles** $P$ and $P'$. 

***

A **spherical triangle** is not just any three-sided figure lying on the surface of a sphere. The sides of a spherical triangle *must* be arcs of certain great circles.
