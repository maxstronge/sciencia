1. What is the overall balanced equation obtained when [**1**] and [**2**] are combined?

[**1**] : $\text{NaHCO}_{3  \textit{ (aq)}} + \text{HCl}_\textit{ (aq)} \to \text{H}_2\text{CO}_{3 \textit{ (aq)}} + \text{NaCl}_\textit{ (aq)}$ 

[**2**] : $\text{H}_2 \text{CO}_{3 \textit{ (aq)}} \to \text{H}_2\text{O}_{\textit{ (l)}} + \text{CO}_{2 \textit{ (g)}}$

Listing all reactants on the left and all products on the right:

$$\text{NaHCO}_{3  \textit{ (aq)}} + \text{HCl}_\textit{ (aq)} + \text{H}_2 \text{CO}_{3 \textit{ (aq)}} \to \text{H}_2\text{CO}_{3 \textit{ (aq)}} + \text{NaCl}_\textit{ (aq)} +\text{H}_2\text{O}_{\textit{ (l)}}+ \text{CO}_{2 \textit{ (g)}} $$

Since $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_{3 \textit{ (aq)}}$ appears on both sides of the equation, we can eliminate it:

>$$\text{NaHCO}_{3  \textit{ (aq)}} + \text{HCl}_\textit{ (aq)}  \to  \text{NaCl}_\textit{ (aq)} +\text{H}_2\text{O}_{\textit{ (l)}}+ \text{CO}_{2 \textit{ (g)}} $$
 
The chemical equation requires no further balancing.

3. Limiting vs. Excess Reagents:

>- **C**: The $\text{HCl}_\textit{ (aq)}$ was the excess reagent in the described experiment.
>
>- **E**: The pH of the resulting solution was $2$.
>
>- **R**: The resulting solution's pH indicates that, after the described reaction takes place, the solution was acidic. Because the reaction is an acid-base reaction, this implies that the acid was initially in excess.
