# Parallax, Motion, and Distance:
***

The Ancient Greek philosopher/astronomer Hipparchus, who is partially credited with the invention of trigonometry, rejected the heliocentric model of the solar system because he could not observe **stellar parallax**, which is predicted by the theory.

**Parallax** is the apparent shift in position of a foreground object relative to other, more distant background objects. *E.g.* when you hold a thumb out at arms length and close one eye, then then other.

When taking measurements involving stellar parallax, to get the most accurate measurement one wants the *largest baseline* ($d\,$) possible.
