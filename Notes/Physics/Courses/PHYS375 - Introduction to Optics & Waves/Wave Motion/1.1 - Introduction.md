waves are super common bro 

Important distinction from oscillations: waves propagate through a medium, moving in space, while oscillations occur at a localized point in space. Thus when discussing waves, we need to identify a medium through which the wave propagates, which must have some spatial dimension, and a velocity with which the wave travels through that medium.

In oscillations, time is the only independent variable - given a time $t$, one can determine the instantaneous values of all other physical properties. 

In wave motion, there is another independent variable - the *spatial coordinate* $x$. This is not to be confused with $x=x(t)$ in the differential equation for an oscillator, which is just the position as a function of $t$.
