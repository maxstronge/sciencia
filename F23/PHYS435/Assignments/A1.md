2. Consider the function given by 
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if} & -\pi \leq x\leq 0  \\
\sin(x) & \text{if} & 0\leq x\leq \pi
\end{cases}
$$
- a) Plot $f(x)$ and comment on its parity,
- b) Calculate the Fourier representation of $f(x)$
- c) Evaluate $f(x)$ and its series representation at $x=0$ to show that
$$
\sum_{n=1,2,3,\dots}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4n^{2}-1}=\frac{1}{2}
$$
- d) Show directly (via partial fractions) that the infinite sum in part c) sums to $\frac{1}{2}$.

3. Consider the non-periodic function $f(x)=1-x$ over the interval $0\leq x\leq 2$.

- a) Construct an odd periodic extension of $f(x)$ for the interval $-2\leq x\leq 2$ and plot the function.
- b) Evaluate the Fourier series for the odd periodic extension in part a).
- c) Now construct an *even* periodic extension of $f(x)$ and plot the function.
- d) Evaluate the Fourier series for the even periodic extension in part c).
- e) Examine the two series for the even and odd extensions and comment on their degree of convergence and the dependence on the shape of the original functions, i.e., which series converges more slowly and why?
