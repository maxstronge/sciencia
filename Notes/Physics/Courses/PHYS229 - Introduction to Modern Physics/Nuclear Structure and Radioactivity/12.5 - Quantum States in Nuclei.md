# 12.5 - Quantum States in Nuclei:
***

Ideally, we would like to be able to solve the SchrÃ¶dinger equation using the nuclear potential energy. This process, if it were possible, would give us a set of energy levels for protons and neutrons that we could then compare with experiment (just as we did for the energy levels of electrons in atoms). Unfortunately, we cannot do this yet for several reasons: the nuclear potential energy cannot be expressed in a convenient analytic form, and it is not possible to solve the nuclear many-body problem except by methods of numerical approximation.

Nevertheless, we can make some simplifications that allow us to analyze the structure and properties of nuclei using familiar techniques. We'll represent the nuclear potential energy as a **finite potential well** of radius *R* equal to the [[12.2 - Nuclear Sizes and Shapes#^e4bd6e|nuclear radius]]. That confines the nucleons to a nucleus-sized region and allows them to move freely in that region. 

Let's consider $^{125}Te$, a nucleus very close to the center of the range of nuclei. The *width* of the potential energy well is equal to the nuclear radius, which we [[12.2 - Nuclear Sizes and Shapes#^2da224|found to be proportional to the cube root of A]]. In this case:

>## $$ R = (1.2fm)(125)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 6.0fm.$$

The second quantity we need to know is the *depth* of the potential energy well. We'll consider the protons and neutrons separately.


The 73 neutrons in $^{125}Te$ will fill a series of energy levels in the potential energy well. The top of the well is at $E = 0$, above which the neutrons would become free. The bottom of the well is at a negative energy $-U_0$. The neutrons fill the levels in the well starting at $-U_0$, and end *not* at energy $E = 0$, but at energy $-6.6\,MeV$, as we found earlier when discussing [[12.3 - Nuclear Masses, Binding Energies, and Separation Energies#^581491|neutron separation energies]]. That is, we must add a minimum of $6.6\, MeV$ to raise the least-tightly-bound neutron out of the well and turn it into a free neutron.

To find the energy difference between the bottom of the well and the highest filled state, we can consider the nucleus to be a *"gas"* of neutrons and protons whose energies are described by the **Fermi-Dirac distribution**. A statistical distribution like this is best suited (and intended) to describe systems with large number of particles, the larger the better, but it should be a reasonable enough rough approximation for our *"gas"* of 73 neutrons.

We can do a similar calculation for the 52 protons...

The figure above shows the protons and neutrons near the top of their respective potential energy wells. 

Note that we can add energy to the nucleus that is less than the proton or neutron separation energies: in the 	region between $E = -S_n \; or \; -S_p$ and $E = 0$ are the **nuclear excited states** in which a proton or neutron can absorb energy and *move from its ground state to one of the unoccupied higher states*. As is the case with atoms, the nucleus can make transitions from **excited states** to lower excited states (or its ground state) via the **emission of photons**. In the case of nuclei, these photons are called **gamma rays** and have typical energies of $~0.1MeV$ to a few *MeV*.

It is also possible, though, to have other types of nuclear transformations. It is clearly not possible for this nucleus to spontaneously emit a proton or neutron - it would take a great deal of energy (many *MeV*s) to boost a bound nucleon to a free state, as detailed in [[12.3 - Nuclear Masses, Binding Energies, and Separation Energies|12.3]]. *However*, it is possible to simultaneously boost *two* protons and *two* neutrons, and form them into an **alpha particle** ($_2^4He_2$). If the energy gained in the formation of the alpha particle (aka its binding energy, $28.3\;MeV$) is greater than the sum of the four separation energies of the four constituent nucleons, there will be a net energy gain in the process; this energy will appear as the *kinetic energy of the alpha particle that is emitted by the nucleus*. This process is called *[[12.7 - Alpha Decay|nuclear alpha decay]].*

We can see, though, from the nucleon separation energies in this case, that this can't occur in $^{125}Te$.

Another type of transformation occurs when a *neutron changes into a proton* and drops into one of the empty proton states at a lower energy. Under other circumstances, in which the proton levels are higher and the neutron levels are lower, the opposite can occur: *a proton can transform into a neutron* and drop into one of the empty neutron states. This process is called *[[12.8 - Beta Decay|nuclear beta decay]]*.
