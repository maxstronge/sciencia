From prior work: the kinetic energy of the electron is $2.17987\times10^{-18}\text{ J} = 13.6 \ eV$. The Bohr radius is $0.529 \ \ang$. 

Since the electrostatic force responsible for the orbit of the electron follows an inverse-square law, like gravitation, we can use the Virial Theorem to relate the kinetic and potential energy: ^[Learned in ASPH403, hopefully it's acceptable to invoke for this class]

> $$U = -2K = -2\cdot(2.17987\times10^{-18}) = -4.35974 \times 10^{-18} \ J.$$

The total energy then is $U + K$:

>$$E = U + K = -K = -2.17987\times10^{-18} \text{ J.}$$

Taking $q=1\text{ C}$, $r$ as the distance from the charge, and $\kappa = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}$:

The electric potential is given by $V(r) = \kappa \frac{q}{r}$ and the magnitude of the electric field by $E(r) = \kappa \frac{q}{r^2}$. Plotting these two functions:
