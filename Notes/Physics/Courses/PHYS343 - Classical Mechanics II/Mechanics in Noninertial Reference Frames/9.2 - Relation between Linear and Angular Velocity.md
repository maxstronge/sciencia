# 9.2 - Relation between Linear and Angular Velocity:

***

There is a useful relation between the **angular velocity** of a rigid body and the **linear velocity** of any point on the body. Consider, for example, the Earth, rotating with angular velocity $\omega$ about its center *O*, which we shall take to be stationary for the present discussion.

Next, consider any point *P* fixed on (or in) the planet (for example, the peak of Mount Everest, or the skull of a Tyrannosaurus embedded deep undergound), with some position $\vec r$ relative to the center of the Earth. We can specify $\vec r$ by its **spherical polar coordinates** $(r, \theta, \phi)$ with the *z*-axis* pointing through the North Pole, such that $\theta$ is the **colatitude**- the latitude measured downwards from the North Pole (instead of the more commonly used latitude measured upwards from the equator). 

As the Earth turns about its axis, the point *P* is dragged in an easterly direction around a circle of latitude, with radius $\rho = r \sin(\theta)$ as shown:

This means that *P* moves with speed $v = \omega r \sin(\theta)$: from the figure, we can see that the *vector* velocity is $\omega \times r$. 

This result is independent of the rotating body; that is, for any rigid body rotating with angular velocity $\omega$ about an axis through *O*, the velocity of any point *P* (with position $\vec r$) fixed on the body is:

> ## $$v = \omega \times r. $$

This is a generalization of the familiar relation $v = \omega r$ learned in introductory mechanics.
