# Basis of Vector Spaces:
***

A vector space is called **finite dimensional** if it is spanned by a finite set of vectors. Otherwise, it is **infinite dimensional**.

$\Rn, \Ppn, \text{ and }\bf{M}_{mn}$ are finite dimensional.

$F(-\infty,\infty)$ is infinite dimensional.

Recall that if $V$ is  a vector space, a set $\{\va{x_1},\va{x_2},\dots,\va{x_m}\}$ is called a **basis** of $V$ if:

1. $V = \span\{\va{x_1},\va{x_2},\dots,\va{x_m}\}$
2. $\va{x_1},\va{x_2},\dots,\va{x_m}$ is linearly independent.
