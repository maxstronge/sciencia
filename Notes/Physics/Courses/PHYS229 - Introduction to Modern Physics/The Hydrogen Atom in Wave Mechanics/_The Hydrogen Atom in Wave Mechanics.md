# The Hydrogen Atom in Wave Mechanics:
***

In this chapter, we study the solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom. We will see that these solutions, which lead to the same energies calculated in the Bohr model, differ from the Bohr model by *allowing for the uncertainty in localizing the electron*.

Other deficiencies of the Bohr model are not so easily eliminated by solving the Schrödinger equation. First, the so-called "fine structure" of the **spectral lines** (the splitting of the lines into close-lying *doublets*) cannot be explained by our solutions; the proper explanation of this effect requires the introduction of a new property of the electron (and all fundamental particles) called the **intrinsic spin**. 

Second, the mathematical difficulties of solving the Schrödinger equation for  atoms containing two or more electrons are formidable, so for now we'll restrict our attention to simple one-electron atoms, in order to see how wave mechanics allows us to understand some basic atomic properties. For more information on many-electron atoms, see [[_Many-Electron Atoms|this chapter]].
