# Electric Displacement:
***

We just found for a polarized dielectric, the bound volume charge density is given in terms of the polarization as

$$\rho_{b}= -\divergence \vec{P}.$$

Gauss's Law tells us that

$$\divergence \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\eo}$$

But the volume charge density is the [[Dielectrics and Polarization#^6ba499|sum of free and bound charge densities ]], so we have

$$\begin{align*}
\divergence \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\eo}\\
&= \frac{\rho_{f}+ \rho_{b}}{\eo}\\
&= \frac{\rho_{f}-\divergence \vec{P}}{\eo}
\end{align*}$$
or....

>$$\divergence \vec{D} = \rho_f$$

where we have introduced a new quantity, the **electric displacement**

>$$\vec{D}=\eo \vec{E}+\vec{P}. $$
