The centripetal force for the orbiting electron is $F_c = \frac{m  v^2}{r}$.

For the electron:
- $m_e = 9.109\times10^{-31}\text{ kg}$
- $r = a_0 = 5.29\times10^{-11}\text{ m}$
- $q = -e\text{ C}$ (equal/opposite to proton)

The centripetal force $F_c$ is the Coulomb force, given by:

$$F_c = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{a_0^2}$$

where the force is directed radially inwards towards the nucleus. We can equate this to the centripetal force above:

$$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{a_0^2} = \frac{m_ev_e^2}{a_0}$$

....which, after rearranging and canceling a factor of the Bohr radius, gives the following expression for the velocity:

>$$v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0 }\frac{e^2}{a_0 m}} = 2.1876\times10^6\text{ m/s.}$$

We can thus find the kinetic energy of the electron:

>$$\begin{align}\text{K} &= \frac{1}{2} \ m_e  v_e^2 \\[2ex] &= \frac{1}{2}(9.109\times10^{-31})(2.1876\times10^6)^2 \\[2ex] &= 2.17987\times10^{-18}\text{ J} \\ &= 13.6 \text{ eV}.  \end{align}$$

This matches the Bohr model's prediction for the electron in a hydrogen atom for $n=1$, so the result is reasonable.

#### a)

Let $\kappa = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}$.

The two charges on the $x$-axis will balance and cancel out, leaving only the two opposite charges on the $y$-axis to contribute to the net electric field (and hence the electric force experienced by the charge at the origin).

The bottom charge has charge $+q$, and is located at position $\left<0,  -l   \right>$. The distance $\va{r}$ between that charge and the probe charge at the origin is thus $\va{r} = \left< 0,0\right> - \left< 0,-l   \right> = \left< 0,l \right> \implies |\va{r}| = \sqrt{0+l^2} = l.$

The direction of the electric field will be determined by $\vu{r}$, which can be found by:

$$\vu{r} = \frac{\va{r}}{|\va{r}|} = \frac{\left<0,l \right>}{l} = \left<0,1 \right> = \vu{y}$$

Since the bottom charge is positive, the electric field due to the positive charge will point upwards in the positive $y$ direction, and the magnitude of the field is given by:

$$E_{\text{ bottom}} = \kappa \frac{q}{|\va|}.$$
