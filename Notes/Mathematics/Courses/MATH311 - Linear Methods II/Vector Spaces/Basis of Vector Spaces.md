# Basis of Vector Spaces:
***

A vector space is called **finite dimensional** if it is spanned by a finite set of vectors. Otherwise, it is **infinite dimensional**.

$\Rn, \Ppn, \text{ and }\bf{M}_{mn}$ are finite dimensional.

$F(-\infty,\infty)$ is infinite dimensional.

Recall that if $V$ is  a vector space, a set $\{\va{x_1},\va{x_2},\dots,\va{x_m}\}$ is called a **basis** of $V$ if:

1. $V = \span\{\va{x_1},\va{x_2},\dots,\va{x_m}\}$
2. $\va{x_1},\va{x_2},\dots,\va{x_m}$ is linearly independent.

Thus if a set of vectors $\{\va{e_1},\dots,\va{e_n}\}$ is a basis, then *every* vector in $V$ can be written as a linear combination of these vectors *in a unique way*. We can extend this to the concept of a basis via the **Invariance Theorem**:

> #### Invariance Theorem [6.3.3]:
> Let $\{\va{e_1},\va{e_2},\dots,\va{e_n}\}$ and $\{\va{f_1},\va{f_2},\dots,\va{f_m}\}$ be two bases of a vector space $V$.
>
>Then:
> #### $$n = m. $$
