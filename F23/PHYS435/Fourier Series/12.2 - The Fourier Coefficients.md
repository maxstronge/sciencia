t puWe now consider how to find the Fourier coefficients for any particular function (that satisfies the [[12.1 - The Dirichlet Conditions and the Fourier Series|Dirichlet Conditions]]).

For a periodic function $f(x)$ of period $L$, we find that the Fourier coefficients are given by:

$$
\begin{align}
a_{r} &= \frac{2}{L}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \, dx  \\

b_{r} &= \frac{2}{L} \int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x)\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \, dx 

\end{align}
$$

where $x_{0}$ is arbitrary, but is often taken as $0$ (to $L$) or $-\frac{L}{2}$ (to $\frac{L}{2}$).

In the [[12.1 - The Dirichlet Conditions and the Fourier Series#^30c7a3|formula for a Fourier series]], there is a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ in the $a_0$ term - this is introduced to ensure that [[#^6cec50| the first of these expressions]] is valid for the case that $r=0$ as well as for $r>0$. That $a_{0}$ term serves as a constant scaling factor of sorts. 

We can derive the formulae for the Fourier coefficients in the following way:

Recall the definition of the Fourier series expansion for $f(x)$:

$$
f(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( a_{r}\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)+b_{r}\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \right)
$$

If we multiply by a factor of $\cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)$ and integrate with respect to $x$ over one full period:

$$
\begin{align}

\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right) \, dx 
&= \frac{a_{0}}{2}\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}\cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)\, dx  \\&+ \sum_{r=1}^\infty a_{r}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} \cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)\, dx \\&+\sum_{r=1}^\infty b_{r}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} \cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)\, dx 
\end{align}
$$

*(We have also changed the order of summation and integration above.)*

We are crucially assuming that $p\neq r$ to take advantage of the fact that successive terms in a Fourier series are **mutually orthogonal**. When $p=0$, the above equation reduces to 

$$
\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x) \, dx  = \frac{a_{0}}{2}L
$$
When $p\neq 0$, the only non-vanishing term on the RHS of the long equation above occurs when $r=p$, and so:

$$
\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)dx = \frac{a_{r}}{2}L
$$
$$

$$
and thus 

$$
a_{r} = \frac{2}{L}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \, dx
$$

Similar logic can be applied to find the coefficients $b_{r}$ by multiplying by $\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)$ instead.
