### **4.1: Heating and Entropy**

Estimate the change of entropy of the universe due to heat escaping from your home on a winter day.


**Solution:**
***


### **4.2: Thermodynamic Entropy**
Two non-ideal gases, $A$ and $B$, whose internal energies only depend on temperature ($U=U(T)$) obey the following equations of state:

$$A: p=\aa_A\frac{NT}{V^2}$$

$$B: p=\left( \bb_B\frac{N}{V}T\right)^{1/2}$$


...where $\aa_A$ and $\bb_B$ are some constants. Determine for both gases whether a well-defined entropy exists. If not, what does that imply?


**Solution:**


***

### **4.3:  Entropy of Radiation**

The equation of state of radiation is $pV=U/3$. Stefan's law states that $U / V=\sigma T^4$, where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

1. Find the entropy of radiation $S=S(V,T)$.
2. During the Big Bang, radiation initially limited to a small region expands adiabatically and cools down. What is the relationship between the temperature $T$ and the radius of the universe? 

**Solution:**
