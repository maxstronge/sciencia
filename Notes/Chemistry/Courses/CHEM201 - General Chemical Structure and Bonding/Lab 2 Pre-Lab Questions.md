1. Which parts of a single atomâ€™s electron configuration are important to know? Hint: there should be at least two things that you identify as important.



The electron configuration of an atom reveals the *number of valence electrons* in the atom, which is crucial for determining what types of reactions are possible. The electron configuration also gives you information about the broad category the atom can be placed into on the Periodic Table, as in the figure below:

These groups have general chemical properties in common, and this information can also be gained from the electron configuration.

2. When comparing the reactivity of two or more alkali metals, what does the electron configuration tell you?

All alkali metals have a valence electron configuration of the form $n s^1$ - all have one valence electron, and so all are highly reactive. The $n$ represents the principal quantum number, and as $n$ increases down the alkali metal group, the *electronegativity* tends to decrease. Since all alkali metals have an equal number of valence electrons, the lower values of $n$ in their electron configurations correspond to higher electronegativity and thus greater reactivity.

3. What is the importance of Equation 2?


$$\ce{OH-_\aq + HIn_\aq \to H2O_\liq + In^-_\aq}$$

The reaction demonstrates reaction between a hydroxide ion and an aqueous indicator solution, forming water and a deprotonated indicator. During the deprotonization, the indicator will change color, indicating a change in PH in the solution as the hydroxide ion 'steals' the hydrogen from the solution, forming water and a negative ion of the indicator. This is helpful for analyzing the chemical process in Eq. 1, giving a visual demonstration of the PH change.

4. If you change the $\ce{M}$ in Eq. 1 to $\ce{Ca}$, does the stoichiometry of equation 2 change? Why? 

**Equation 1**:

$$\ce{2M_\sol + 2H2O_\liq \to H2_\gas + 2M+_\aq + 2OH-_\aq}$$

**Equation 2**:

$$\ce{OH-_\aq + HIn_\aq \to H2O_\liq + In^-_\aq}$$

Changing the M in Eq. 1 to Ca, we have: 

$$\ce{2Ca_\sol +2H2O_\liq \to H2_\gas + 2Ca+ _\aq + 2OH-_\aq.}$$

This equation is still balanced - we can check the other one by creating a net ionic equation combining Eq. 1 and 2:

$$\ce{2Ca_\sol + 2H2O_\liq + OH-_\aq + HIn_\aq \to H2_\gas + 2Ca+ _\aq + 2OH- _\aq + H2O_\liq + In- _\aq }$$

Some species will cancel:

$$\ce{2Ca_\sol + H2O_\liq  + HIn_\aq \to H2_\gas + 2Ca+ _\aq + OH- _\aq + In- _\aq }$$

But the stoichiometric ratios remain unchanged.

5. Curved Arrow Mechanism

The presence of acetylsalicylic and citric acids in the tablet may have an effect on the neutralization reaction between the sodium bicarbonate and the hydrochloric acid. The sodium bicarbonate has more acids to potentially neutralize compared to a solution exclusively containing $\ce{HCl}$ and $\ce{NaHCO3}$ - however, this is unlikely, as the hydrochloric acid is a much stronger acid than either citric or acetylsalicylic acid, and thus is more inclined to lose a proton than the other two compounds mentioned.
