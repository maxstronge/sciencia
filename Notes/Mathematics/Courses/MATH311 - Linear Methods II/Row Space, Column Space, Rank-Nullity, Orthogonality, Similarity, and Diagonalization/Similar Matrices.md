# Similar Matrices:

***

**Definition**: If $A$ and $B$ are *square* matrices, we say that $A$ is **similar** to $B$, denoted $A \sim B$, if there exists some invertible matrix $P$ such that $B = P^{-1}AP.$

- *e.g.* $A=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\-2&4 \end{bmatrix}$ and $B=\bmqty{2&0\\0&3}$ are similar, since
