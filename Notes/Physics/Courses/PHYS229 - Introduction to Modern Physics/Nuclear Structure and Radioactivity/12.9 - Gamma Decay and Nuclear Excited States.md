# 12.9 - Gamma Decay and Nuclear Excited States

***

Following [[12.7 - Alpha Decay|alpha]] or [[12.8 - Beta Decay|beta]] decay, the final nucleus may be left in an **excited state**. Just as an atom does, the nucleus will reach its **ground state** after emitting one or more photons, known as **nuclear gamma rays**. The energy difference of each photon is the energy difference between the initial and final nuclear states, minus a (typically negligible) small correction for the **recoil kinetic energy** of the nucleus. The energy of emitted gamma rays are typically in the range of ~$10\;keV$ to a few $MeV$. Nuclei can likewise be excited from the ground state to an excited state by *absorbing* a photon of the appropriate energy.

Typical values for the **half-lives** of the excited states are $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-12}s$ (although there are occasional cases of excited states with half-lives of hours, days, or even *years*).

When a gamma-ray photon is emitted, the nucleus *must recoil* to conserve momentum. The photon has energy $E_\gamma$ and momentum $p_\gamma = E_\gamma/c$. The nucleus recoils with momentum $p_R$. If the nucleus is initially at rest, then momentum conservation requires that $p_R = p_\gamma$ in magnitude, of course in opposite directions. The recoil energy $K_R$ is small, so **nonrelativistic** equations can be used for the nucelus (of mass *M*):

> ## $$K_R = \frac{p^2_R}{2M} = \frac{p^2_\gamma}{2M}=\frac{E^2_\gamma}{2Mc^2} .$$

For a medium-mass nucelus of $A=100$ and a large gamma-ray energy of $1\;MeV$, the recoil kinetic energy is only $5\;eV$.

Suppose a gamma ray is emitted when the nucleus jumps from an initial state with energy $E_i$ to a final state with energy $E_f$. Conservation of energy requires that:

> ## $$E_i = E_f +E_\gamma +K_R, $$

...so the energy of the emitted gamma ray is:

> ## $$E_\gamma = E_i- E_f - K_R \cong E_i- E_f. $$

(The term of $K_R$ is neglected because, again, it is negligibly small.)

In calculating the energies of alpha and beta particles in radioactive decays, we have thus far assumed that no gamma rays are emitted. If there *are* gamma rays emitted, the available energy (the *Q* value) must be shared between the other particles and the gamma ray(s).

## Example: Radioactive Decays with Gamma-Ray Emissions:

$^{12}N$ beta decays to an excited state of $^{12}C$, which subsequently decays to the ground state with the emission of a $4.43\,MeV$ gamma ray. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted beta particle?

**

To determine the *Q* value for this decay, we first need to find the mass of the product nucleus $^{12}C$ **in its excited state**. In the ground state, $^{12}C$ has a mass of 12.000000 *u*, so its mass in the excited state (before emitting a gamma ray) must be:

>## $$m(^{12}C^*) = 12.000000 u + \frac{4.43\,MeV}{931.5\,MeV/u} = 12.004756 u.$$

In the decay from nitrogen to carbon, clearly a proton must change into a neutron - this is an example of **positron decay** (as outlined [[12.8 - Beta Decay#^da552e|here]]). According to the equations for that process, the *Q* value here is:

> $$ \begin{align}
Q & = [m(^{12}N) - m(^{12}C^*)-2m_e]\;c^2\\
& = [12.018613 u - 12.004756 u -2(0.000549u)]\times (931.5\,MeV)\\
& = 11.89\;MeV.\\
> \end{align} $$

Thus, the maximum allowed kinetic energy for the beta particle is $11.89\;eV$.
