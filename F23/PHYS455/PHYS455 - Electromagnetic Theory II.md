## Course Outcomes:

- Use Maxwell's equations for both electrostatics and magnetostatics  
- Exploit the interrelationship between the electric and magnetic potentials and fields  
- Articulate and employ the uniqueness theorems as they pertain to electrostatics  
- Compare and contrast the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in matter and these fields in a vacuum  
- Employ vector analysis to show how electric and magnetic fields are vector fields  
- Model and analyze electrostatic and magnetostatic configurations using Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems 
- Solve partial differential equations with the standard techniques for physics

## Notes:

- Oral components
	- 20 minute appointment - given a question (individual!) to solve in advance, 10min to explain how to solve the question, methodology, etc. 7 minutes of cross-examination
