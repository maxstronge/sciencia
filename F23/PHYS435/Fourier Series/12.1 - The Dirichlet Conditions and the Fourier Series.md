dThe **Dirichlet Conditions** are the requirements that must be met in order for a function to be expressible as a Fourier series. The conditions can be summarized in the following four points:

1. The function must be periodic (or at least a subset of the function's domain)
2. It must be *single-valued* and *continuous* (except possible at a finite number of discontinuities)
3. It must have a finite number of extrema within a single period
4. The integral *must converge* over one period of $|f(x)|$.


If the above conditions are satisfied, then the Fourier series converges to $f(x)$ at all points where $f(x)$ is continuous. The last three conditions are almost always met in real applications, but not all functions are periodic. It may be possible, however, to represent non-periodic functions as Fourier series by manipulation of the function into a periodic form.

The Fourier series expansion of a function $f(x)$ is conventionally written in the following way:


$$
f(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( a_{r}\cos\left( \frac{2\pi nx}{L} \right)+b_{r}\sin\left( \frac{2\pi nx}{L} \right) \right)
$$

...where $a_{0},a_{n}$, and $b_{n}$ are constants called the **Fourier coefficients**. 

These coefficients are analogous to those in a power series expansion (i.e. Taylor/Maclaurin), and the determination of their values is the essential step in writing a function $f(x)$ as a Fourier series. 


**NB:** On an assignment, if Dr. Ahmadi does not explicitly ask us to determine whether a function meets the Dirichlet conditions, we assume it does and proceed from there.
