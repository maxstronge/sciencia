# 7.3 - The Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions: 

***

To find the complete spatial description of the electron in  a hydrogen atom, we must obtain three-dimensional wave functions. The Schrödinger equation in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates has the following form:

> ### $$\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2}\right)+U(x,y,z)=E\psi(x,y,z)$$
...where $\psi$ is a function of *x, y,* and *z*. 

The usual procedure for solving a differential equation of this type is to separate the variables by replacing a function of three variables with the product of three functions of one variable - for example, $\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$. However, the [[25.1 - The Electric Potential Energy#^6f845b|Coulomb potential energy]], written in Cartesian coordinates as $U(x,y,z) = \frac{-e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2})}$, does not lead to a separable solution. 

For this calculation, it ends up being more convenient to work in **spherical polar coordinates** $(r, \theta, \phi)$ instead of the Cartesian coordinates, as illustrated below.

This simplification of the solution comes at the expense of an increase in the complexity of the Schrödinger equation, however: in spherical polar coordinates, the equation becomes:

>##### $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[ \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} +\frac{1}{r^2 \sin(\theta)}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( \sin(\theta)\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2(\theta)}\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] + U(r)\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = E \psi(r,\theta,\phi). $$


...which is an abominable result. However, when the potential energy depends only on *r* ( and not on $\theta$ or $\phi$, as is the case for the Coulomb potential energy), we can find solutions that *are* separable, and can be factored as:

>### $$\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r)\,\Theta(\theta)\,\Phi(\phi) $$

...where the **radial function** $R(r)$, the **polar function** $\Theta(\theta)$, and the **azimuthal function** $\Phi(\phi)$ are each functions of a *single variable*. This procedure gives three differential equations, each of a single variable.

The quantum state of a particle that moves in a potential energy that depends only on *r* can be described by **angular momentum quantum numbers** *l* and $m_l$. The polar and azimuthal solutions are given by combinations of standard trigonometric functions (citation needed). The remaining radial function is then obtained by solving the radial equation:

> #### $$\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\left(\frac{d^2R}{dr^2}+\frac{2}{r}\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+\left( -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} + \frac{l(l+1)\hbar^2}{2mr^2} \right)R(r) = E \; R(r).$$

The mass that appears in this equation is the **reduced mass** of the proton-electron system (see [[8.2 - Center of Mass, Relative Coordinates, and the Reduced Mass of a System]] for more details.)

> ## Quantum Numbers and Wave Functions:

 

When we solve a three-dimensional equation such as the Schrödinger equation, three parameters emerge in a natural way as indices/labels for the solutions. These indices are the **quantum numbers** that label the solutions. The three quantum numbers and their allowed values are as follows:
***

 $$\begin{array}{ccc}
n & principal \; quantum \; number & 1,2,3,... \\

 

l  & \;angular \; momentum \; quantum \; number & 0,1,2,...,n-1 \\

 
m_l & magnetic \; quantum \; number & 0,\pm 1 ,\pm 2,...,\pm l \\

\end{array}$$ 

***

The **principal quantum number** *n* is identical to the quantum number *n* that was obtained in the [[6.5 - The Bohr Model|Bohr Model]]. It determines the quantized energy levels:

> ## $$E_n = - \frac{me^4}{32\pi^2\epsilon_0^2\hbar^2}\frac{1}{n^2}. $$

This is the same result as the Bohr model as well. Note that the energy depends *only* on *n*, and not on *l* or $m_l$. This is because the permitted values of the **angular momentum quantum number** *l* are limited by *n*, and the values of the **magnetic quantum number** $m_l$ are in turn limited by *l*.

Complete with quantum numbers, the separated solutions of the three-dimensional Schrödinger equation for hydrogen can be written as:

> ## $$\psi_{n,l,m_l}(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{n,l}(r)\Theta_{l,m_l}(\theta)\Phi_{m_l}(\phi). $$

Wave functions corresponding to various combinations of indices are listed in the [[Table of Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions]]. 



Each of these sets of quantum numbers corresponds to a *very different* wave function, despite having nearly identical energy, and therefore represents a very different *state of motion* of the electron. These states have different **spatial probability distributions** for locating the electron, and thus affect many atomic properties - for example, the way a particular atom will form molecular bonds. 

The radial wave functions for the first three states of hydrogen are plotted below.

> ## Probability Densities:

As discussed in [[5.3 - The Schrödinger Equation|our discussion of the Schrödinger equation]], the probability of finding a particle in any spatial interval is determined by **the square of the wave function**.

For the hydrogen atom, $\vert\psi(r,\theta,\phi)\vert^2$ gives the **volume probability density** in three-dimensional space (probability per unit volume) at the location $(r,\theta,\phi)$. To compute the actual probability of finding the electron, we multiply the probability per unit volume by the infinitesimal volume element $dV$ located at that location. This volume element is sketched below:

![[Pasted image 20210419112553.png]]

In spherical polar coordinates, the volume element is:

> ## $$dV = r^2 \sin(\theta) \;dr\; d\theta\; d\phi. $$

Therefore, the **probability to find the electron in the volume element at that location** is:

> ### $$ \vert \psi_{n,l,m_l}(r,\theta,\phi)\vert^2 \; dV = \vert R_{n,l}(r)\vert^2\;\vert \Theta_{l,m_l}(\theta)\vert^2\;\vert\Phi_{m_l}(\phi)\vert^2\;r^2 \sin(\theta)\;dr\;d\theta\;d\phi.$$
