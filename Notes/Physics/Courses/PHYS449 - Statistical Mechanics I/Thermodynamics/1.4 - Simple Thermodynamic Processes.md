# 1.4 - Heat and Work
***

Much of thermodynamics has to do with temperature, energy, and heat. Do not confuse these things! Energy is quite fundamental, but we can talk about two main types of energy *flow*: heat and work.

**Heat** is defined as the spontaneous flow of energy from one object to another, caused by a difference in temperature. We say that 'heat' flows from a warm radiator into a cold room - regardless of mechanism, the energy transferred is called heat. 

**Work** is defined in thermo as any other (nonspontaneous) transfer of energy in or out of a system. Usually there is some agent that actively puts energy in or removes it.

There is no heat and work *in* a system - these are just terms that refer to energy in transit. 

We use the symbol $U$ for the total energy content of a system. Thus we have

$$\DD U = Q+W$$


as a consequence of conservation of energy. This is the **1st Law of Thermodynamics**.

### Simple Thermodynamic Processes for an Ideal Gas:

The most common example of work done in thermodynamics is the compression of a gas:

Since work is defined as a generalized force $J$ times a generalized coordinate $q$, we have for a simple gas:

$$\dd W = \sum\limits_{i=n}^{m}J_idq_i$$

$$\dd W = -pdV$$

...a helpful relation between work, pressure, and volume. 

If we have the pressure as a function of volume, $p=p(V)$, we can do this as an integral:

>$$\dd W = -\int\limits_{V_i}^{V_f}p(V)dV \ \text{[quasi-static]}$$ ^33a09d

Two important idealized ways to compress an ideal gas: **isothermal** and **adiabatic** compresion.

Isothermal compression is so slow that the temperature of the gas doesnâ€™t
rise at all - adiabatic compression is so fast there is not time for heat to spontaneously flow in or out. Most real processes are in the middle of these two extremes.


Starting with isothermal compression: constant temp $\implies$ quasi-static process, so we can use [[1.4 - Simple Thermodynamic Processes#^33a09d|the above]]:

$$
\begin{align} 
W &= -\int\limits_{V_i}^{V_f}p(V)dV \\ 

&= -Nk_BT \int\limits_{V_i}^{V_f}\frac{1}{V}dV \\ 

&= -Nk_BT (\ln V_f - \ln V_i) \\ 


&= Nk_BT \ln(\frac{V_i}{V_f}).


\end{align}
