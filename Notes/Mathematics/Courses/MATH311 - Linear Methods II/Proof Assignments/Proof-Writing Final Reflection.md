**Note:** while not particularly substantive, I couldn't find anything to comment on in the proof (which was very well done) and this was one of the only ones that did not yet have a reply.

*Note*: this is a response to a different topic - I lost track of which I had commented on.

### Reflection:


MATH311 has been my first foray into the world of proofs - I haven't yet taken the introductory course in discrete math, so I was slightly nervous about the more abstract, logical thinking required for these proof-writing assignments. Now that the 5 proofs are written and the course is nearly over, I can safely conclude that these exercises have helped me to become a more complete mathematician. The most interesting thing about these proof-writing assignments to me is the aspect of peer-review included in them. In my opinion, the fact that proofs were uploaded publicly to D2L and constructive criticism from peers was encouraged provided value in two ways. 

The first way has to do with the writing and posting of the proofs: since the proof was written with the knowledge that it would be uploaded publicly, I started writing 'defensively', *i.e.* trying to look at my work from the perspective of someone who will be trying to critique it. This is excellent training for future work, and I expect it is a crucial skill when trying to publish any original work. By keeping that defensive perspective, I was naturally more inclined to search for holes in my logic, or places in which my argument was unclear. 

The second source of value comes from the other side - that of the one providing commentary. Much like how the format of the assignments encouraged defensive writing, the part where we commented on other's proofs gave us experience with evaluating the logic of a mathematical proof. On the one hand, we got practice looking for the various forms of logical errors we learned about in the Error Classification guide - improper assertions, false implications, incorrect usage of theorems, and others. Sometimes these were immediately evident, but other times some deeper analysis was required. 

On the other hand, we were also advised to provide positive feedback. This was not just an exercise in softening the blow of constructive criticism, in vein of the 'complement sandwich' idea - by searching through a peer's proof
