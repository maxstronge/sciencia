# Vector Spaces:

***
Many mathematical entities have the property that they can be *added* and *multiplied* by a number. 

Numbers themselves have this property, as do $\mxn$ matrices: the sum of two such matrices is again an $\mxn$ matrix, as is any scalar multiple of such a matrix. 

Polynomials are another familiar example, as are the geometric vectors we examined in introductory linear algebra. 

It turns out that there are many other types of mathematical objects that can be added or multiplied by a scalar, and the general study of such systems is introduced in this topic. Remarkably, a great deal of 	the work we've done so far in terms of subspaces of $\Rn$ can be formulated in this generality. We call these general mathematical entities **vector spaces**.
