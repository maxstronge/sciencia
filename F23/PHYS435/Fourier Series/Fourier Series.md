In [[4.1 - Series|a previous chapter]], we examined how complicated functions could be expressed as a **power series**. We now turn to a different method of representing functions as series, namely as the sum of sine and cosine terms. This representation is called the **Fourier Series.**

Unlike a **Taylor Series**, Fourier series can be used to represent functions that are *not* differentiable and continuous everywhere. 

Other advantages of using trigonometric terms:
- easy to differentiate/integrate
- moduli easily taken
- each term contains only one characteristic frequency

This last point is especially salient to physical applications as Fourier series are routinely used to examine the response of a system to a periodic input, i.e. vibrations of a finite string, scattering of light by diffraction grating, etc.
