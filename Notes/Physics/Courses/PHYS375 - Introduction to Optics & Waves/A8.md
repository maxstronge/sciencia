1. There are two LC transmission lines. The first has the following parameters:

$$\frac{L}{\Delta x}= 1.0\times10^{-4} \text{ [H/m]} \qq{,} \frac{C}{\Delta x}=20\times10^{-12}\text{ [F/m]}$$
The second has the following parameters:

$$\frac{L}{\Delta x}= 3.0\times10^{-4} \text{ [H/m]} \qq{,} \frac{C}{\Delta x}=50\times10^{-12}\text{ [F/m]}$$

**a)** Find the velocity of electromagnetic waves on each transmission line.
**b)** Find the impedance of each transmission line.
**c)** We saw in Chapter 6 that 

$$V_{r}= \frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}V_i$$

and we know that voltage must be continuous (as a scalar function, one single point in space cannot have multiple different voltages). 

If a $1\text{ V}$ pulse signal (w.r.t. ground) is sent down the first transmission line, which connects to the second transmission line, what's the voltage of the reflected signal? What's the voltage of the transmitted signal?

Show that energy is conserved in this interaction; the following equation will help:

$$\frac{V_{i}^{2}}{Z_{1}}=\frac{V_{r}^{2}}{Z_{1}} + \frac{V_{t}^{2}}{Z_{2}}$$

**Solutions:**

**a)** We can derive a wave equation for the LC transmission line in the following way:

We select one section of the transmission line located at $x$, and assign currents and voltages as in the following figure from the textbook (Hirose):

![[Pasted image 20221121115219.png]]

**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law** requires that the sum of voltage drops around a closed loop is equal to zero. Applying this to the circuit element above, we find:

$$V(x,t)=L \pdv{I(x,t)}{t}+ V(x+ \Delta x, t)$$

**Kirchhoff's Current Law** states that the sum of the currents that enter a node is equal to $0$ yields:

$$I(x,t)=C \pdv{V(x,t)}{t} + I(x + \Delta x, t)$$

but the first term in the RHS really should be written as 

$$C \pdv{V(x+\Delta x,t)}{t}.$$

However, assuming $\Delta x$ is sufficiently small, we may use a Taylor Series expansion for $V(x+\Delta x,t)$ as 

$$V(x+ \Delta x, t) \approxeq V(x,t)+\Delta x \pdv{V(x,t)}{t}$$

..and $\pdv{t}V(x+ \Delta x,t)$ can be approximated with $\pdv{t} V(x,t).$ 


The current at location $x + \Delta x$ can also be Taylor series expanded as 

$$I(x+ \Delta x,t) \approxeq I(x,t) + \Delta x \pdv{I(x,t)}{t}.$$

After substituting these two Taylor series approximations into the two equations built from Kirchhoff's laws, we find:

 $$\begin{align*}
- \Delta x \pdv{V(x,t)}{t} &= L \pdv{I(x,t)}{t}.\\
\\
 
- \Delta x \pdv{I(x,t)}{t} &= C \pdv{V(x,t)}{t}.
\end{align*}$$



These are two coupled first-order differential equations for $V(x,t)$ and $I(x,t)$. 

Next, we differentiate the first of these equations with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$ and the next with respect to time $t$, to obtain:

$$\begin{align*}
- \Delta x \pdv[2]{V(x,t)}{x} &= L \pdv{I(x,t)}{x}{t}\\
\\
- \Delta x \pdv[2]{I(x,t)}{t}{x} &= C \pdv[2]{V(x,t)}{t}
\end{align*}$$

Since, via equality of mixed partials, $$\pdv[2]{I(x,t)}{x}{t}= \pdv[2]{I(x,t)}{t}{x}$$
...this term can be eliminated, and we can obtain a PDE for the voltage $V(x,t)$:

$$\pdv[2]{V(x,t)}{t}= \frac{(\Delta x)^2}{LC}\pdv[2]{V(x,t)}{x}$$

A similar equation for the current $I(x,t)$ can be obtained by a similar procedure, instead differentiating the first equation with respect to time $t$ and the second with respect to space $x$. This yields:

$$\pdv[2]{I(x,t)}{t} = \frac{(\Delta x)^{2}}{LC} \pdv[2]{I(x,t)}{x}$$

The previous two equations are of the form of a wave differential equation. The propagation velocity can thus be immediately found as

$$c_{w} = \frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

or, alternately, 

$$c_{w} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{L}{\Delta x}\cdot \frac{C}{\Delta x}}}$$


Therefore, with the inductance and capacitance per unit length known, we can find the velocity of electromagnetic waves for each transmission line. 

For the first:

$$c_{w_{1}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{L_{1}}{\Delta x}\cdot \frac{C_{1}}{\Delta x}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1.0\times10^{-4} \text{ [H/m]}\cdot 20\times10^{-12}\text{ [F/m]}}} = 2.236\times10^{7}\text{ m/s}$$

....and the second:


$$c_{w_{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{L_{2}}{\Delta x}\cdot \frac{C_{2}}{\Delta x}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3.0\times10^{-4} \text{ [H/m]}\cdot 50\times10^{-12}\text{ [F/m]}}} = 8.165\times10^{6}\text{ m/s}$$

**b)** The characteristic impedance $Z_c$ for the two transmission lines can be expressed in terms of the inductance and capacitance per unit length as well:

$$Z_{c}= \sqrt{\frac{\text{inductance per unit length}}{\text{capacitance per unit length}}}$$

And so we can easily find the characteristic impedances for each transmission line:

$$Z_{c_{1}}= \sqrt{\frac{\frac{L_{1}}{\Delta x}}{\frac{C_{1}}{\Delta x}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.0\times10^{-4} \text{ [H/m]} }{20\times10^{-12}\text{ [F/m]}}}=2236.07 \ \OO. $$


$$Z_{c_{2}}= \sqrt{\frac{\frac{L_{2}}{\Delta x}}{\frac{C_{2}}{\Delta x}}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.0\times10^{-4} \text{ [H/m]} }{50\times10^{-12}\text{ [F/m]}}}=2449.59 \ \OO. $$

**c)** We earlier made use of Kirchhoff's voltage and current rules in our derivation of the wave equation. These laws are statements of conservation of energy, in the context of circuits. They require that energy is conserved in a closed conducting path, which our circuit is, so we can use the relation 

$$\frac{V_{i}^{2}}{Z_{1}}=\frac{V_{r}^{2}}{Z_{1}} + \frac{V_{t}^{2}}{Z_{2}}$$

Where $V_i,V_{r},$ and $V_{t}$ are the voltages of the incident, reflected, and transmitted pulses, respectively. The pulse originates in $LC_1$, and we know that $LC_{2}$ has a greater impedance, so there will be reflection. 

We can take advantage of the conservation of energy and use the relation for impedance changes found earlier:

$$\begin{align*}
V_{r} &= \frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_{1}+Z_2}V_i\\
\\
&= \frac{2449.49-2236.07}{2236.07+2449.49}\left(1\text{ V}\right)\\\\

&= 0.0455488\text{ V}
\end{align*}$$

So the reflected pulse has voltage $0.04555\text{ V}$. 

We can then use the energy conservation equation above to find the voltage of the transmitted pulse:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{V_{i}^{2}}{Z_{1}}&=\frac{V_{r}^{2}}{Z_{1}} + \frac{V_{t}^{2}}{Z_{2}}\\\\

\frac{(1\text{ V})^{2}}{2236.07} &= \frac{(0.04555\text{ V})^{2}}{2236.07}+\frac{V_t^2}{2449.49} \\\\

\frac{1-(0.04555)^{2}}{2236.37} &= \frac{V_{t}^{2}}{2449.49}\\\\

2449.49\cdot(0.000446225)&=V_{t}^{2}\\\\

V_{t}&= 1.04548 \text{ V}.
\end{align*}$$

2. It can be shown that the transmission line  pictured below (the traditional one with a stray capacitance, which happens in actual transmission lines over long distances) has waves that obey the equation $$\pdv[2]{V}{t}=\frac{(\Delta x)^{2}}{LC_{1}}\pdv[2]{V}{x}+\frac{C_2}{C_{1}}(\Delta x^{2})\pdv[4]{V}{t^2}{x^2}.$$

**a)** This equation models shallow water waves, and sound in an ionized gas (plasma), called the **ion acoustic wave**. Find the dispersion relationship for this wave.
**b)** Find the group velocity and the phase velocity. Show that the wave becomes nondispersive when $C_{2}\to 0$.

**Solution:**

**a)** If we assume a sinusoidal voltage wave $V(x,t)=V_{0}\sin(kx-\oo t)$, by taking partial derivatives of $V(x,t)$ w.r.t. time and space and rearranging, we find the dispersion relation to be the following:

$$\oo^{2}= \frac{1}{1+\frac{C_1}{C_{2}} (\Delta x^{2}k^{2})}\frac{(\Delta x)^{2}}{LC_1}k^2$$



**b)** The phase velocity is then
$$v_{p}= \frac{\oo}{k}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{1+\frac{C_1}{C_{2}} (\Delta x^{2}k^{2})}\frac{(\Delta x)^{2}}{LC_1}}$$

The group velocity can be found by differentiating $\oo$ with respect to $k$, resulting in the following horrible expression:

$$v_g=\frac{\frac{2 \Delta x^2 k}{C_{1} L \left(\frac{C_{1} \Delta x^2 k^2}{C_{2}}+1\right)}-\frac{2
   \Delta x^4 k^3}{C_{2} L \left(\frac{C_{1} \Delta x^2 k^2}{C_{2}}+1\right)^2}}{2
   \sqrt{\frac{\Delta x^2 k^2}{C_{1} L \left(\frac{C_{1} \Delta x^2 k^2}{C_{2}}+1\right)}}}$$
....which the author ran out of time to simplify further. But it's not the same as the phase velocity, so there is dispersion!

It can be seen that when $C_{2}= 0$, the entire second term on the RHS of the wave equation becomes zero, leaving us with
$$\pdv[2]{V}{t} = \frac{(\Delta x)^{2}}{LC_{1}}\pdv[2]{V}{x}$$

...the form of a dispersionless wave equation.

4. A coaxial cable has an inner radius of $2\times 10^{−4}\text{ m}$  and an outer radius of $3 \times 10^{−3} \text{ m}$ and is filled with a dielectric material of $\epsilon_r=2.0.$ Find:

**a)** The velocity of electromagnetic waves in the cable.
**b)** The characteristic impedance of the cable.

**Solutions:**

Electromagnetic waves can propagate inside the cavity formed by two cylindrical conductors. If the cylinder were filled with vacuum, we would find the speed as 

$$c_w=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_{0}\eo}}=c=299,792,548\text{ m/s}$$
But the cavity is not filled with vacuum, it is filled with a dielectric material with $\epsilon_{0}=2$  - and so the permittivity of the medium will change, as it is no longer just $\eo$, it must be $\epsilon_{r}\eo$:

$$c_w=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_{0}\eo\epsilon_{r}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\mu_{0}\eo}}=2.11985\times 10^{8}\text{ m/s}$$

**b)** The characteristic impedance $Z_c$ can be found via 
$$Z_c=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\eo}}\frac{1}{2 \pi}\ln\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$$

where $a$ and $b$ are the inner and outer radii of the conductors. Again, though, since the medium is not vacuum but the dielectric, we must add the term $\epsilon_r$:

$$Z_c=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\eo\epsilon_{r}}}\frac{1}{2 \pi}\ln\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$$This follows from the previous equation relating $Z_c$ to the inductance and capacitance per unit length, with the potential found by using Gauss's law to find the field of the dielectric. 

We can solve directly:

$$Z_{c}= \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\eo}}\frac{1}{2 \pi}\ln\left(\frac{3\times10^{-3}}{2 \times10^{-4}}\right)=114.813\ \OO.$$

6. From the dimensions for $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, show that the **Poynting flux** $S$ indeed has the dimensions of watts per square meter. (Introduce a vector $\mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{B}}{μ_{0}}$ having a dimension of amperes per meter.)

**Solution:**

To begin with, we introduce a vector $\mathbf{H}= \frac{\mathbf{B}}{μ_{0}}$ that has a dimension of amperes per meter. The electric field has dimensions of volts per meter. Since the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular, $\mathbf{E}\cross \mathbf{B}$ (and by extension, $\mathbf{E}\cross \mathbf{H}$, since $\mu_{0}$ is a scalar) will have dimensions of the product of the dimensions of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ for each component:

$$\frac{V\times A}{m^2}$$

and since a voltage multiplied by an amperage has units of power, Watts, the Poynting flux has units of Watts per square meter:

$$\frac{W}{m^{2}}$$

as expected.

7. Parallel-wire transmission lines are most commonly used for low-frequency (including dc) power transfer. In the schematic diagram of Figure 9–40, sketch roughly the electric and magnetic field profiles, and show that the Poynting vector is directed from the battery to the load everywhere. Would you expect that the 2 parallel wires will be attracted to each other or repelled from each other because of the magnetic force? What about the electric force?

![[Pasted image 20221122131506.png]]

**Solution:**

The following diagram illustrates the situation nicely:

![[jz6Fj.png]]

Since the currents on the conducting wires are opposite, I would expect the magnetic force between the two to be repulsive. For the system to be in mechanical equilibrium then, there must be some electric force that cancels out the repulsion, leading to an attractive electric force between the wires. An examination of the direction of the electric field lines (the arrows on the above diagram) compared to the magnetic field lines suggest that the forces are indeed in opposition. Mathematically, they will be balanced for some value of the resistance $R$ for the resistor.

10. A giant laser pulse has a power density $1020 \text{  W/m}^{2}$. Calculate the rms value of the electric field associated with the laser pulse.

**Solution:**

We can relate the root-mean-square value of the Poynting vector to that of the electric field in the following way:

$$S_\text{rms}=\frac{1}{2}c\eo \mathbf{E}_{0}^{2}=c\eo \mathbf{E}_\text{rms}^{2}$$
Since the power density is indeed the vector $S$, we have 

$$10^{20} \text{W/m}^2=\frac{1}{2}(3\times10^{8}\text{ m/s})\eo \mathbf{E_\text{rms}^{2}}$$


$$\sqrt{2\frac{10^{20}}{3\times10^{8}\eo}}=\mathbf{E}_\text{rms}=2.74397\times10^{11} \text{ V/m}$$

However, half of this power is in the magnetic field, while the other half is in the electric, so we must divide this value by 2:

$$\mathbf{E}_\text{rms}=1.37199\cdot10^{11} \text{ V/m.}$$

12. A $1\text{ g}$ target completely absorbs the energy of a laser pulse ($500\text{ MW}$, $10\text{ ns}$ duration). Find the momentum to be gained by the target and the velocity. Discuss the quantity of the momentum, and how that would affect measurement ability.

**Solution:**

Via conservation of momentum, the target will gain the entirety of the momentum of the laser pulse incident on it if the energy is completely absorbed. First, recall that the energy associated with a single photon is given by

$$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}=3.1\times10^{-19}\text{ Joules per photon.}$$

...where a red laser with wavelength $630\text{ nm}$ was assumed.  The laser has power $500\times10^{6}\text{ W}$, or $5\times 10^{8}$ Joules per second. Thus, with a duration of $10\text{ ns}$, the energy delivered is $$\frac{5\times 10^{8}}{1\times10^{-8}}=5\times10^{16}\text{ J}$$

which corresponds to  

$$n_{\text{photons}}= \frac{5\times10^{16}}{3.1 \times 10^{-19}}=1.613\times10^{35}\text{ photons}$$

The momentum of a single photon is given by 

$$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}=1.05176\times10^{-27}\text{ kg m s}^{-1}$$

Thus the momentum of all the photons incident on the target is

$$p\cdot n_{\text{photons}}=1.05176\times10^{-27}(1.613\times10^{35})=1.69638\cdot10^{8}\text{kg m s}^{-1}.$$
It is here that the author noticed that this is, frankly, an absurd amount of momentum, and after considering the solutions in the textbook, decided that there must be an error in the question - the laser power was probably meant to be given in units of milliwatts, not megawatts. In fact, the "most powerful handheld laser you can legally own" is only around $3500\text{ mW}$, so this seems reasonable. 

The correct momentum of all the photons incident on the target is 

$$\sum p = 1.69638\times 10^{-8}\text{ kg m s}^{-1}$$

And thus this is the momentum gained by the target due to conservation of momentum. 

Since the mass of the target is known, we can easily find the resulting velocity:

$$v=\frac{p}{m}=  \frac{1.69683\times10^{-8}}{0.001\text{ kg}}=1.69638\times10^{-5}\text{m s}^{-1}.$$

This is a much more reasonable amount of momentum: that is to say, not much at all. The resulting velocity of the target is incredibly small, meaning precise measurement of the velocity gained by the target may be very difficult.
