- Over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries CE, the nature of European warfare changed dramatically - unsettled argument as to how/why/what the consequences were

## Late Medieval Warfare:

- Medieval armies were (as far as we can tell) raised by obligation/social contract, but supplanted by *contract* (i.e. mercenary) forces from 1400 onwards (in emergencies, could levy the commoners)
- England/France fighting a 100 years war - the idea of 'obligation' got tested (who wants to volunteer to sit on a field and get dysentery for months at a time?)

## Gunpowder & Early Artillery

- Gunpowder (sulfur, saltpetre and charcoal) - first invented in China, but its development limited by the context (Yuan dynasty, Mongol empire) - security context: pastoral nomads from the North (Mongolia) - not super useful for military to bring heavy guns to chase down fast-moving horse archers
- The Mongols almost definitely played a role in the transmission of gunpowder knowledge/technologies across Eurasia into Europe/Near East by the 14th century - these regions are competitive and fractured -> good for military tech dev
- development of counter-siege technology/fortifications, etc

## The Ottoman Threat

- the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople -> Istanbul (1453) closed off trade routes with the East
- Portugal and the newly-unified states of Castille/Aragon (now Spain under Ferdinand and Isabella
- These westernmost European states were seeking new allies/trade routes, leading to...

## European Voyages of 'Discovery'

- several developments in technology (sextants, printing press->maps) made sea travel more practical/reliable over the course of the 15th century CE
- In 1519-22, Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigated the globe (he dies partway through) ![[images.jpg]]
- Portuguese entered the Indian Ocean circa 1498 to seize control of the local trade scene - building fortifications etc - use of naval military dominance to control/protect trade

## Conclusion:

- interaction of technological developments (gunpowder, printing press, fortification theory) and changing organization (growing urbanization, literacy, decline of power of the church), and intense competition - changes the rules of engagement
- Warfare shifted from being an aristocratic pursuit to being dominated by paid standing armies/navies, mercenaries, using gunpowder weapons - incentivizing state centralization
- Some argue this process marked the beginning of European powers outcompeting rival civilizations
