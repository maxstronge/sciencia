# 6.4 - Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron Configurations):

***

Having introduced the basics of atomic structure and [[_The SchrÃ¶dinger Equation|quantum mechanics]], we can use our understanding of *quantum numbers* to determine how atomic orbitals relate to one another. This allows us to determine which orbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of the chemical properties of the atom.

### Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure:

The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the [[7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom|principal quantum number]], *n*, increases. In any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of subshells with different values of $\ell$ differ, so that the energy of the orbitals *increases* within a shell in this order:

> ### $$s < p < d < f.$$

The *1s* at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy (most stable / least reactive). 

The energy increases as we move up to the *2s*, *2p*, *3s*, and *3p* levels - notice that the increasing *n* value has more impact on the energy than the increasing $\ell$ value, at least for small atoms. This pattern does not hold for larger atoms, though (notice that the *4s* orbital is lower in energy than the *3d* orbital).
