# 1.A - $R^n$ and $C^n$

***


The set of **real numbers** with which we are familar is denoted as **$R^n$**. 

**Complex numbers** were invented so that we can take square roots of *negative* real numbers. The symbol *$i$* was first used to denote $\sqrt{-1}$ by *Leonhard Euler* in $1777_{CE}$.

If $a \in {R}$, we identify $\mathit{a + 0i}$ with the real number $a$. Thus, we can think of $\bf{R}$ as a subset of $\bf{C}$. We also usually write $\mathit{0+bi}$ as just $bi$, and $\mathit{0+1i}$ as just $i$.

The above properties define $\bf{R} \text{ and } \bf{C}$ to be **algebraic rings**.

These additional properties identify $\bf{C}$ as an algebraic **field**. The real numbers $\bf{R}$ form a field as well. So that we can easily make definitions and prove theorems that apply to both the real and complex numbers, we adopt the following notation:
***
> #### 1.6: Notation - Algebraic Fields
>  Throughout this book, we use $\bf{F}$ to denote both $\bf{R}$ and $\bf{C}$. 

***

This way, when we prove a theorem involving $\bf{F}$, we will know that it holds in both $\bf{R}$ and $\bf{C}$. 

Elements of $\bf{F}$ are called **scalars**. The word *scalar* refers to a number, as opposed to a vector.

## Lists:

Before defining $R^n$ and $C^n$, consider two important examples:

> #### 1.7: Definition of $R^2$ and $R^3$
> - The set $\bf{R}^2$ defines a **plane**, and is the set of all *ordered pairs* of *real numbers*:
> > $$\bf{R}^2 = \{ (x,y): x, y \in \bf{R} \}.$$
> - The set $\bf{R}^3$ represents 3-dimensional space, with which we are familiar. It is the set of all *ordered triples* of *real numbers*:
> > $$\bf{R}^3 = \{(x,y,z):x,y,z \in \bf{R}\}.$$
***

To generalize $R^2$ and $R^3$ to higher dimensions, we need to discuss the concept of **lists**.

> #### 1.8: Definition of lists and length
> Suppose *n* is a nonnegative integer. A **list** of **length** *n* is an *ordered collection* of *n* elements (which may be numbers, other lists, or more abstract entities), separated by *commas* and surrounded by *parentheses*. A list of length *n* looks like this:
> > $$(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n). $$ 

Two lists are equal if and only if they have the same length, with the same elements in the same order. 

Thus a list of length 2 is an ordered pair, and a list of length 3 is an ordered triple.

Many mathematicians refer to lists of length *n* as **n-tuples.** By definition, each **n-tuple** has a finite length that is a nonnegative integer. Thus an object like:

$$(x_1, x_2, \dots), $$

...which has infinite length, is not considered a list. 

A list of length zero looks like this:

$$(),$$

...and we consider such an object to be a list containing 0 elements to avoid trivial exceptions to theorems. 

Lists differ from **sets** in two major ways: in lists, *order* and *repetition* are both meaningful; in sets, both order and repetitions are irrelevant.
