# The Electromagnetic Spectrum:

***

We have covered the wave-particle duality of light extensively in [[3.2 - The Photoelectric Effect]] and [[3.1 - Review of Electromagnetic Waves]]. When talking about subatomic effects in this course, we will tend to model light as being made of particles called **photons**. Recall some important points:

- Photons travel through space at the speed of light ($c = 3\times10^8\,m/s$)
- This is the fastest attainable speed in the universe by Einstein's special relativity
- Photons are massless (but they do possess kinetic energy and momentum)


Also recall that light also behaves like (and is) an electromagnetic wave, and light waves can *interfere* with one another (either constructive interference or destructive interference). 

When treating light as a wave, we have certain notations and terminology to work with:

- Light has a *wavelength*, typically denoted by $\ll$, the distance between two successive maxima/minima of the wave - unit of distance, can range from $m$ to $fm$ (femtometers)
- The wave also has an *amplitude*, defined as the height of the wave's maxima above the mean - sometimes denoted $A$, represents energy (along with wavelength)
- Instead of wavelength, we can also refer to *frequency*, the number of wave crests that pass a certain point in one second - units of inverse time, given often as $f$ or $\nu$ (which is a Greek nu, not a v). Measured in Hertz ($Hz$).


Recall from before that we can use a simple equation to relate wavelength to frequency:


> ## $$c =  \nu \ll$$

We can see that frequency and wavelength are inversely related.

We can also find the energy of a light wave as follows:

> ## $$E = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\ll} $$

...where $h$ is Planck's Constant $= 	6.626\times10^{-34}\,J\cdot s.$
