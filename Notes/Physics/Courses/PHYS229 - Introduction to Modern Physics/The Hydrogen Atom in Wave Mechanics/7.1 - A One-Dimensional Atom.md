# 7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom: 

***

Quantum mechanics gives us a view of the structure of the hydrogen atom that is quite different from the [[6.5 - The Bohr Model|the Bohr Model]]. In the Bohr model, the electron moves about the proton in a circular orbit. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, does not allow a fixed radius (or a fixed orbital plane) but instead describes 	the electron in terms of a probability density, which leads to an uncertainty in the location of the electron. 

To analyze the hydrogen atom according to quantum mechanics, we must solve the Schrödinger equation for the [[25.1 - The Electric Potential Energy|Coulomb potential energy]] of the proton and the electron:

> ## $$ U(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}.$$

Eventually,  we will discuss the solutions to this problem in three dimensions using spherical polar coordinates, but for now we'll confine ourselves to the simpler **one-dimensional problem**, in which a proton is fixed at the origin ($x = 0$) and an electron moves about the positive *x*-axis. (This obviously doesn't represent a real atom, but it does show how some properties of **electron wave functions** in atoms emerge from solving the Schrödinger equation.)

In one dimension, the Schrödinger equation for an electron with potential energy $U(x) = -e^2 /4 \pi \epsilon_0 x$ is:

> ## $$ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 x}\psi(x) = E \psi(x).  $$

For a bound state, *the wave function must fall to zero as $x \to \infty$.* Moreover, in order for the second term on the left side (the Coulomb potential energy) to remain finite at $x = 0$, the wave function $\psi(x)$ must be zero at $x = 0$.

The simplest function that satisfies these requirements is:

> ## $$\psi(x) = Axe^{-bx} $$

...where *A* is the **normalization constant**. By substituting [[7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom#^b3b92e|this wave function]] into the [[7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom#^1d0ab8|Schrödinger equation for this case]], we find a solution when...

> ### $$ b = \frac{me^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_o \hbar^2} = \frac{1}{a_0}$$

...where $a_0$ is the [[6.5 - The Bohr Model#^d773ed|Bohr Radius]].

The energy corresponding to this wave function is:

> ## $$E = \frac {-\hbar^2 b^2}{2m} = \frac {-me^4}{32 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^2} $$

...which is identical to the energy of the **ground state** in the Bohr Model.

The figure above plots this wave function and its corresponding **probability density** $\vert{\psi(x)}\vert^2$ (the shaded region under the curve). The *x*-axis is in units of multiples of $a_0$. There is clearly an uncertainty in specifying the location of the electron. The most probable region to find the electron is near $x = a_0$, but there is a nonzero probability to find the electron *anywhere between $x = 0$ and $x = \infty$*. This is clearly a divergence from the Bohr Model, in which the distance of the electron from the nucleus is fixed at $a_0$.

## Example: Finding the Normalization Constant for a One-Dimensional Hydrogen Atom:

*Find the normalization constant of the ground
state wave function for a particle trapped in the
one-dimensional Coulomb potential energy.*

The normalization integral here is: 

> ### $$\int_0^{\infty} \vert \psi(x) \vert ^2 dx = 1.$$

Replacing $\psi(x)$ with our [[7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom#^aad838|wave function]]:

> ## $$A^2 \int_0^\infty x^2 e^ {\frac {-2x} {a_0}}dx = 1. $$

This integral is in a standard form that is found in integral tables that we will frequently use in analyzing wave functions. The solution in general form is:

> ####	 $$\int_0^{\infty}x^ne^{-cx}dx = \frac{-e^{-cx}}{c}\times\left(x^n +\frac{nx^{n-1}}{c}+\frac{n(n-1)x^{n-2}}{c^2}+...+ \frac{n!}{c^{n+1}}\right). $$

Using this general form with $n = 2$ and $c = \frac{2}{a_0}$, the normalization integral becomes:	

> ## $$A^2 \frac{2!}{(2/a_0)^3}=1 $$

...which leads us to:


> ## $$A = 2a_0^{\frac{-3}{2}}. $$
