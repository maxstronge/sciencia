# 8.2 - Center of Mass, Relative Coordinates, and the Reduced Mass of a System:
***

Our first task is to decide which **generalized coordinates** to use for our **Lagrangian**. There is already a strong suggestion that we should use the **relative position** *r* for one of them, since it leads to such a simple form for the potential energy $U$, but what other variable should we use? 

The best choice turns out to be the **center of mass** (or *CM*) position, [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass|whose position is defined here]]. 

> ## $$R = \frac{m_1r_1 + m_2r_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{m_1r_1 + m_2r_2}{M} $$
> ...where *M* is the combined mass of both objects. 

The *CM* lies on the line connecting the center of the two bodies as shown:

 We have seen earlier that the *total momentum* of two point masses is the same as if the total mass $M =m_1+m_2$ were concentrated at the *CM* and were following the *CM* as it moves:
 
 > ## $$P = M \dot R. $$

This result has important simplifying consequences: We know, of course, that the total momentum is constant via conservation. Therefore, according to the above, $\dot R$ is constant, and this means we can choose an *inertial reference* frame in which the *CM* is at rest. This ***CM* frame** is an especially convenient frame from which to analyze the motion, as we shall soon see. 

We will use the *CM* position $R$ and the relative position $r$ as our generalized coordinates for our discussion of the two bodies. In terms of these coordinates, we already know that the potential energy takes the simple form $U = U(r)$. We can rewrite both $r_1$ and $r_2$ in terms of $R$ and $r$:

> ## $$r_1 = R + \frac{m_2}{M}r \qquad and \qquad r_2 = R - \frac{m_1}{M}r. $$

Thus, the kinetic energy $T$ turns out to be:


> ## $$T = \frac{1}{2}(M \dot R^2 + \frac{m_1m_2}{M}\dot r^2) .$$

This result simplifies further if we introduce the parameter:

> ## $$\mu = \frac{m_1m_2}{M} $$

...which has units of mass, and is called the **reduced mass** of the system. We can see that $\mu$ is always less than both masses - hence the name. 

We can now rewrite the kinetic energy as:

> ## $$T = \frac{1}{2}M \dot R^2 + \frac{1}{2}\mu \dot r^2. $$

This remarkable result shows that the kinetic energy is the same as that of two *fictitious* particles: one of mass $M$ moving at the speed of the *CM*, and one of mass $\mu$ moving at the speed of the relative velocity, $r$.

Even more significant is the corresponding result for the Lagrangian:


> ## $$\mathcal L = T - U = \frac{1}{2}M \dot R^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\mu \dot r^2 - U(r) \right). $$

> ## $$= \mathcal L_{CM} + \mathcal L_{Rel}.  $$
