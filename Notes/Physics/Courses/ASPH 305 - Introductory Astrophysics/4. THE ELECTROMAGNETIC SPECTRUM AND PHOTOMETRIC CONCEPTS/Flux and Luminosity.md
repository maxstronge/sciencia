# Flux and Luminosity:

***

Consider a star emitting radiation in every direction of space (*i.e.* over 4$\pi$ [[Spherical Trigonometery#^df6b3f|steradians]]).

**Luminosity**  is defined as the *total amount of energy* emitted in all directions per second, denoted $L$, and is measured in units of $J/s$ or $W$. It can also be measured as  a function of wavelength or frequency. 

Because the direction of every photon is (for the most part) normal to the surface of a sphere, the photons will â€˜spread outâ€™ as they propogate outwards, such that the *density* of the photons decreases proportionally to the distance from the source.

What we measure, with our eyes or with our instruments, is **luminosity per surface area**, *i.e.*, we collect photons using light buckets in our eyes and in telescopes. 

This quantity is called the **Flux** or brightness of the radiation. Flux is defined as the *amount of radiation passing through a surface* at a given time.  

We can relate flux and luminosity via the following equation:

> ### $$L = \int F d A = F \int d A. $$
