# Spherical Coordinate Systems:

Spherical coordinates are a much more natural coordinate system when dealing with the Earth and the sky above it (both of which can be modeled as spheres). 

A typical example of spherical coordinates on Earth is the longitude/latitude system.

### The Equatorial System:

The **Equatorial Plane** is the reference plane for this coordinate system. It defines a latitude of $0\degree$ and is perpendicular to the rotational axis of the Earth through the center. 

**Parallels of latitude** are small circles that run parallel to the equator outwards to the poles (latitude $90\degree$). 

**NB:** When we refer to the poles in this coordinate system, we mean the **geographical** poles, not the magnetic ones (which vary slightly over time). The **Pole** is the intersection between the rotational axis and all the meridians of longitude. 

**Meridians** are great circles (semicircles) that connect the two poles.

**Longitude** is the angle between the meridian and the meridian of $0\degree$ (called the **prime meridian**, running through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich). Longitude is measured as positive numbers (angles) with a direction, East or West of Greenwich.

### The Horizontal System:

Since our view of the sky depends on our geographical position on Earth, it turns out to be useful to define a coordinate system for the sky *based on our position on Earth*.

A key feature of the horizontal system is the **horizontal plane** - an approximation of the ground modeled as the tangent plane to the surface of the Earth at the location of the observer.
