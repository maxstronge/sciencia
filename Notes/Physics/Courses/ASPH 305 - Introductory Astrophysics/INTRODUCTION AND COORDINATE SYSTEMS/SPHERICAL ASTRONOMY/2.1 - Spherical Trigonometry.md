# 2.1 - Spherical Trigonometry: 

___

For the coordinate transformations of spherical astronomy, we need some mathematical tools, which we will present now. 

We need a coordinate system that will allow us to identify and locate points that essentially fall on the surface of a sphere (see [[COORDINATE SYSTEMS|the notes on the celestial sphere]]).

If a *plane* passes through the center of a sphere, as in the figure below, it will split the sphere into two identical *hemispheres* along a circle called a **great circle**. 

There are also **small circles**. Small circles are formed by the intersection of a plane with the sphere, like great circles, with the distinction that the plane of intersection does *not* go through the center of the sphere.

On Earth, we have a similar coordinate system used by geographers/geologists/etc. Lines of **longitude** are *great circles* that all converge at the northern and southern poles, and *small circles* form lines of **latitude** (except for the equator, which is a great circle). 


In spherical space, the shortest distance between any two points is not a straight line, as it is in flat Euclidean geometry - the shortest distance between any two points lies on a great circle. 

A line perpendicular to the plane passing through the center of the sphere will intersect the sphere at the **poles** $P$ and $P'$.

A **spherical triangle** is not just any three-sided figure lying on the surface of a sphere. The sides of a spherical triangle *must* be arcs of certain great circles, as in the figure below.

The above spherical triangle *ABC* has three arcs *AB*, *BC*, and *AC* as its sides. If the radius of the sphere is *r*, the length of the arc *AB* is:

> ### $$|AB| = rc, [c]=\text{rad}$$

...where *c* is the angle subtended by arc *AB* *as seen from the center*.  This angle is called the **central angle** of the side *AB*. Because the lengths of sides and central angles correspond to each other uniquely, it is customary to give the central angles instead of side lengths. In this way, the radius of the sphere *does not enter* into the equations of spherical trigonometry.

**Note:** in the above formula, $r =$ the radius of the sphere $\iff$ the circle is a **great circle**. 

For small circles, we use the radius of the small circle:

> ### $$|ab|= r \theta $$

...where *r* is the radius of the small circle, and $\theta$ is the central angle as before.

This is a departure from the usual Euclidean trigonometry: the length of a side of a right-triangle, $|AB| =r \tan(c)$ is **not** the same as the length of arc $|AB|=rc$.

However, for small angles, $\tan(\theta)\approxeq \theta$. The limits of 'small angle' really depend on the needed precision of the calculation. Therefore, for small angles, spherical trigonometry reduces to the Euclidean. 

Nevertheless, we can calculate the **true size** of any object if we can measure its **angular size**, *c*, and we know its **distance**, *r*. 

Conversely, if we know both the angular and true size of the object, we can find the distance. 

Some key observations re: spherical trigonometry:

1. For a given angular size $\alpha$, the more distant the object, the greater its true (linear) size.
2. For a given *linear* size, the more distant the object, the smaller its angular size.
3. An object's linear size *D*, angular size $\alpha$, and distance *d* can be related by:

> ## $$D = d \alpha. $$

....or, for small angles....

> ## $$D = rc. $$

### Angular Sizes:
When discussing angular sizes, more precision is needed than can be conveniently given with degrees or radians. We define the following units for angular sizes:


> $1 \degree = 60'$ (arcminutes)
> $1' = 60''$ (arcseconds)

A finger held at arms length will subtend ~$1 \degree$ in the sky - a fist will subtend $10 \degree$.

### Spherical Area:

Like Euclidean triangles, spherical triangles also have an area (specifically, surface area). The calculation of this area, however, differs from the Euclidean case due to the curvature of the geometry.

First: the sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is always **greater than** 180$\degree$; the excess:

> ### $$E = A + B + C - 180\degree $$

...is called the **spherical excess**. It is not constant, but depends on the nature of the spherical triangle. The area of a spherical triangle is related to the spherical excess in a simple way:

> ### $$\text{Area} = Er^2, \, [E\,] = \text{rad}. $$

The angular area on the sky (denoted $d\Omega$ on the above figure) is called the **solid angle**. The solid angle is in units of **steradians** ($\text{rad}^2$), often abbreviated as *sr*. Much like there are $2\pi$ radians in the circumference of a circle, there are $4\pi$ steradians in the entire surface of a sphere.
