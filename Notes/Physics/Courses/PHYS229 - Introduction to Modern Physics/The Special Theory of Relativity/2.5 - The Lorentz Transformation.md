# 2.5 - The Lorentz Transformation:
***

We have seen that the Galilean transformations of coordinates, time, and velocity are not consistent with Einstein's postulates. Galilean relativity agrees with our intuition at relatively low speeds, but it falls apart at high speeds when compared to experimental results. We therefore need a new set of transformations that replace the Galilean set that is capable of predicting relativistic effects such as **time dilation**, **length contraction**, and **relativistic velocity addition**. 

As before, we seek a set of transformations that enable observers $O$ and $O'$ in relative motion to compare their measurements of the space-time coordinates of the same event. The transformation equations relate the measurements of $O$ (namely, $x,\ y,\ z,\ t$ ) to those of $O'$ ($x',\ y',\ z',\ t'$).

This new transformation must have several properties: it must be **linear**, depending only on the first power of the coordinates, which follows from the apparent homogeneity of spacetime; it must be consistent with Einstein's postulates in that results measured in any frame are equally 'valid', and that the speed of light cannot be exceeded in any frame; and it must reduce to the Galilean transformation when the relative speed between *O* and *O'*, to preserve the correct intuition at slow speeds.  We assume for now that the velocity of *O'* relative to *O* is in the positive *xx'*-direction. 

This new transformation consistent with special relativity is called **the Lorentz transformation**, given by the following equations:

>$$\LARGE\begin{align}
 x' & = \frac{x-ut}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} = \gamma(x-ut) .\\
y' & = y .\\
z' & = z .\\
t' & = \frac{t-(u/c^2)x}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} = \gamma \;(t-(u/c^2)\,x)  .\\
\end{align}$$

where...

> ### $$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^2}{c^2}}} .$$

The Lorentz transformation can also be used to move relate coordinates in the other direction:

>$$\LARGE\begin{align}
 x & = \frac{x'-ut'}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} = \gamma(x'-ut') .\\
y & = y' .\\
z & = z' .\\
t & = \frac{t'-(u/c^2)x'}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} = \gamma \;(t'-(u/c^2)\,x')  .\\
\end{align}$$


It is often convenient to write these equations in terms of *intervals* of space and time by replacing each coordinate with the appropriate interval (replace $x$ by $\Delta x$, etc.)

These equations are written with the assumption that *O'* moves *away* from *O* in the *xx'*-direction - if it moves *toward* *O*, replace all instances of *u* with *-u*.

From this set of transformations, we can derive a number of the predictions of special relativity, proving that the Lorentz transform is consistent with Einstein's postulates:

## Length Contraction:

![[Pasted image 20210421094454.png]]

Consider a rod of length $L_0$ at rest in the reference frame of $O'$. The rod extends along the $x'$-axis from $x_1'$ to $x_2'$; that is, $O'$ measures the **proper length** $L_0 = x_2' - x_1'$. An observer in frame $O$, relative to whom the rod is in motion, measures the ends of the rods to be at the coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$. For $O$ to determine the length of the moving rod, $O$ must make a *simultaneous* determination of $x_1$ and $x_2$, such that the length as measured in $O$ is $L = x_2 - x_1$. Suppose the first event is the observer in $O'$ setting off a flash bulb at one end of the bulb at $x_1'$ and $t_1'$, which $O$ observes at $x_1$ and $t_1$, and the second event is $O'$ setting off a flash bulb at the other end of the rod ($x_2', \, t_2'$) which $O$ observes at $x_2$ and $t_2$	. The equations of the Lorentz transform relate these coordinates:

> ## $$x_1' = \gamma\,(x_1 - u t_1),\qquad x_2' = \gamma\,(x_2 - u t_2).$$

Subtracting these two equations, we obtain:

> ## $$x_2' - x_1' = \gamma \,(x_2 - x_1)- \gamma u (t_2 - t_1). $$


In order for $O$ to make an accurate measurement of the length, the two flashes must be simultaneous to $O$ (they will *not* be simultaneous to $O'$, as we'll see later). If $O$ observes the flashes to be simultaneous, then $t_1 = t_2$ and the Lorentz transform reduces to:


> ## $$x_2' - x_1' = \gamma \,(x_2 - x_1) $$

...which, with $x_2' - x_1' = L_0$ and $x_2 - x_1 = L$, becomes:

> ## $$L_0 = \gamma L,\quad \text{or,} \quad L = L_0 \frac{1}{\gamma}.$$

## Time Dilation:
Consider an observer in a frame $S$ that measures the time elapsed between two ticks of a stationary clocks. That observer experiences two events: the first tick, which occurs at coordinates $(x_1,y_1,t_1)$, and the second tick, $(x_1,y_1,t_2)$. 

The duration experienced by the observer in $S$ is equal to $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$, and is referred to as the **proper time**. 

An observer in $S'$, moving at a velocity $\vec u$ relative to $S$, makes the same measurements for the same clock. Applying the Lorentz transformation equations:

>  $$\LARGE
\begin{align}
t'_1 & = \gamma \left( t_1 - \frac{u}{c^2}x_1  \right)\\
 t'_2 & = \gamma \left( t_2 - \frac{u}{c^2}x_1  \right)\\
 \\[5pt]
 \Delta t'&= t_2' - t_1' = \gamma (t_2 - t_1) - \gamma \frac{u}{c^2}\left( x_1 - x_1\right)\\
 & = \gamma \Delta t.
 \end{align}$$

The duration between each tick of the clock is longer according to the moving observer in $S'$.
