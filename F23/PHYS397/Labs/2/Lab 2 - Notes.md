An oscillation is a regular variation in some quantity (i.e. magnitude or position) about an equilibrium point. A period is then the time it takes for a system to complete one full oscillation and return to the original configuration.

***

L represents the length of the string - this will affect the period of the oscillation (assuming mass is the same).

We determine the length by measurement (ruler has uncertainty of $\pm 0.05$cm), and got

$$
L=101.0\pm 0.05\text{ cm}
$$

Adjusted the length after tying the mass:

$$
L=88.2\pm 0.05\text{ cm}
$$
