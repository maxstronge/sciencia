Need some guidance for a software development project I'm working on. You're familiar with Wolfram Mathematica - my goal is to create an interface to some sort of computer algebra system that is easier and more intuitive to use than Mathematica, but with similar functionality. For low level calculations, this might be as simple as providing a fancy-looking, easy to use frontend for sympy calculations - using things like macros to make the experience faster (for example, typing 'sr' after a term will autocorrect to that term ^2 - while rendering all the math input and output as latex on the screen. I want this to be something that is valuable for visual and kinesthetic learning styles as well, so I'm envisioning the user being able to click and drag to rearrange terms in an equation, for example. To start, I just want to create a visual interface that reproduces as much of Mathematica's functionality as possible, with a priority on these features: - simple symbolic algebra - derivatives - indefinite and definite integrals (analytic solution steps using some sort of decision tree) - plotting 2D and 3D functions and vector fields
