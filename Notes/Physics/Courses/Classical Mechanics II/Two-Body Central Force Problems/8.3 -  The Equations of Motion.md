# 8.3 -Â  The Equations of Motion:
***

With our Lagrangian written, we can now write down the equations of motion for our two-body system. Because $\mathcal L$ is independent of $R$, the $R$ equation (really three equations, one each for the *x, y,* and *z* coordinates) is especially simple:

> ## $$M \ddot R = 0 \qquad \text{or,} \qquad \dot R = \text{constant.}$$
