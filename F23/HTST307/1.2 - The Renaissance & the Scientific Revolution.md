- concerned with reviving 'classical' (i.e. Greco-Roman) culture/ideas using the original context of the sources (what does this say about the human condition, politics, etc.)
- begins in wealthy, urbanized, competitive Italian city-states in the 14th century
- begins with Humanism - attributed to Petrach (clerk/writer/poet) - value experiencing/life, wanted to expand literacy/education
- this type of philosophy blended into political theory as well (launched that field) - 'civic humanism' - Niccolo Machiavelli


## The Printing Press

- c. 1450, German craftsman merged a number of disparate technologies (movable type, paper, etc) to create **typography** - massive democratization of knowledge/information (Gutenberg et al)
- Also plays a role in standardizing language
- Was *not* immediately copied by rival civilizations (actually banned in the Ottoman empire, losing monopoly on knowledge, etc)
- Europe is too politically fragmented to stop it

## The Protestant Reformation

- People were growing increasingly dissatisfied with Rome and their religious policies (thru the church)/centralized power by the early 16th century
- Martin Luther wrote a critique of the religious administration (particularly the sale of *indulgences*, like a FastPass for heaven)
- Nailed these 99 points (theses) to the wall of the Wittenberg church, launching a spiritual schism that led to the Protestant Reformation
- At the same time, the church is being dismantled as a parallel power structure by large parts of Europe (in England especially, changing religious law so he could get divorced)
- Printing press accelerates reform and makes it harder to stop - especially in the context of competing military powers (can't get left behind)


## Scientific Revolution:

- Galileo -> Copernicus -> Brahe -> Kepler -> Newton/Leibniz
- Heliocentrism, calculus, gravitation, orbital mechanics (ellipses)
- Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564)
	- Established physical parameters of human body - dissected cadavers (frowned upon)
	- 'father of anatomy'
- Also a revolution in epistemology
	- Francis Bacon (1561-1626) - founder of the modern scientific method (inductive reasoning vs deductive)
- John Locke (1632-1704) - political philosophy, 'blank slate', one of the founding fathers of modern liberalism

## Summary:

- Medieval European society, fragmented and competitive, revived Greco-Roman ideas/learning, extended to all areas of inquiry (political philosophy, scientific revolution, etc)
- These ideas/transformations were driven by innovations in technology (printing press, telescope, microscope, etc)
- Promoted culture of individualism
