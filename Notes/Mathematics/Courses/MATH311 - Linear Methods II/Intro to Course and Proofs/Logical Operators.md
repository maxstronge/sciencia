# Logical Operators:

 **Statement**: a sentence that can be classified as either **true** or **false**.
 
**Implication**: a conditional statement of the form "if *p*, then *q*...". In mathematical notation, this is written as $p \implies 	q$, where *q* is **implied** by *p*. 
 
> For example, the statement "*a square matrix $\bf{A}$ is invertible*" implies that the determinant of $\bf{A}$ is not equal to zero. 

 
> $$\mathit{x}\text{ is even } \implies \frac{x}{2} \in \bf{I}.$$


**Equivalence**: $p \iff q$ is true when both $p \implies q$ and $q \implies p$ are true. 
> $$\bf{A}\text{ is invertible } \implies \det(\bf{A})\neq 0.$$

**Negation**: negation of a statement $p$, denoted as $\sim p$ or $\neg p$, giving $p$ the opposite truth value. Note: in this class, when we say '*a* or *b*', we mean that it is either *a*, *b*, or both (inclusive 'or').
>*e.g. * the negation of the statement "*n* is prime and odd" would be:
> - *n* is *not* prime, *or* *n* is even. 

**Converse**: the converse of a statement $p \implies q$ is $q \implies p$. Note: the converse of a true statement is *not* necessarily true. 

> The converse of the statement "if *n* is a positive integer, $n+3$ is also a positive integer" is....
> - 'if $n+3$ is a positive integer, then *n* is also a positive integer."
> - This is clearly untrue, even though the converse is absolutely true. 

**Contrapositive**:  the contrapositive of an implication $p \implies q$ is $\neg\, p \implies \neg\, q$: *not p* implies that it is also *not q*. 

> *e.g.* if $n+3$ is *not* a positive integer, then *n* is also *not* a positive integer.  This is true - in fact, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.
