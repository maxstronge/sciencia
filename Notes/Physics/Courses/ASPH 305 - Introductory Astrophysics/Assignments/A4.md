One common task performed by astronomers is to identify the atoms and molecules that produce observed spectral lines, as well as the quantum states from which they arise. The figure on the right is a radio wavelength spectrum of a rotational transition (*i.e.* $n_{\text{upper}}$ to $n_{\text{lower}}$). You may assume that the only allowed transitions are between adjacent energy levels (*i.e.* $\DD n = \pm 1$ for hydrogen, and $\DD J = \pm 1$ for the molecule). Based on *i)* the Bohr model for the hydrogen atom and *ii)* the table and figure below (which provide a spectrum and the rotation constants for 6 different molecules), determine:

- a)  which hydrogen transition (*i.e.* $n_{\text{upper}}$ to $n_{\text{lower}}$) produces the observed spectral line, and which of these lines belongs to hydrogen and which to the molecule. Do not use any H transitions with $n_{\text{upper}} \gt 200$. 
- b) which rotational transition (*i.e.* $J_{\text{upper}}$ to $J_{\text{lower}}$) of which molecule produces the observed spectral line. Do not use any molecular transitions with $J_{\text{upper}} \gt 6$.

**NB**: Use high precision constants:

- $R = 13.6056981 \ eV$
- $h = 6.62607004 \times 10^{-34} \ J \, s$
- $1 \ eV = 1.602176565\times10^{-19} \ J.$

**Solution**:

  **a)**
  
The energy emited in a transition between two adjacent energy levels, $n$ and $n-1$, can be given by the following formula:

$$\DD E = E_f - E_i = h \nu = R \qty(\frac{1}{(n-1)^2}-\frac{1}{n^2}).$$

We can rearrange the above equation to isolate the frequency $\nu$:

$$\nu = \frac{R}{h} \qty(\frac{1}{(n-1)^2}-\frac{1}{n^2})$$

We need to solve this equation to determine which values of $n$ will result in one of the transitions displayed on the plot. 

The spike on the left corresponds to a frequency of $1.55 \times 10^9 \ Hz$. Inserting that frequency into the above equation and solving numerically for $n$ yields $n\approx 162.418.$ 

Doing the same for the second frequency, $1.62 \times 10^9 \ Hz$ gives $n\approx160.051$. 

Since $n$ must be an integer, we can conclude that the electronic hydrogen transition $n_{160}\to n_{159}$ most likely resulted in the spike on the right of the plot, and the decimal portion of our answer is a result of rounding. 

**b)**

The energy emitted by a molecular rotational transition (for simple diatomic molecules) can be given by 

$$E_\text{rot} = BJ(J+1), $$

where $B$ is the rotational constant for that molecule and $J$ is the rotational quantum number. Here, we are looking for $\DD E$, the energy emitted as a molecule 'spins down', falling from some energy level $E_i$ to $E_f$, where $E_i>E_f$.Therefore:

$$\DD E = E_f - E_i = BF(F+1) - BI(I+1). $$

Since we assume the energy levels are adjacent, we can say that $I=J$ and $F=J-1$, leaving us with:

$$\DD E = BF(F+1) - BI(I+1) = B(J-1)(J) - BJ(J+1)$$

$$= (BJ-B)(J) - BJ^2 - BJ = BJ^2-BJ-BJ^2-BJ$$

$$=-2BJ.$$

Therefore, the energy emitted in the transition is $2BJ$ (since it must equal the energy lost by the molecule).

So the equation we need to solve (since $B$ is a frequency in hertz and $\nu$ is a frequency in hertz) is:

$$\nu = 2BJ$$

Solving numerically once again, inserting the remaining frequency spike on the spectrum ($1.55\times10^9 \ Hz$) for $\nu$, we find the following values for various molecular rotational constants $B$:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Molecule</th>
		<th>(MHz)</th>
		<th>J</th>
		
	</tr>
	<tr>
		
			<td>A</td>
			<td>25.167</td>
			<td>30.7943</td>
			
	</tr>
		<tr>
		
			<td>B</td>
			<td>51.334</td>
			<td> 15.0972</td>
		
	</tr>
		<tr>
		
			<td>C</td>
			<td>107.639</td>
			<td>7.19999</td>
		
	</tr>
	<tr>
		
			<td>D</td>
			<td>167.553</td>
			<td> 4.6254</td>
		
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>E</td>
			<td>193.701</td>
			<td>4.00101</td>
	</tr>
	 <tr>
			<td>F</td>
			<td>238.747</td>
			<td>3.24611</td>
	 </tr>
			
	
</table>

Much like the previous question, this value of $J$ should be an integer, and the closest $J$ obtained to an integer was from molecule $E$ - hence, that is the molecule that produed the observed spectral line at $\nu = 1.55\times10^9 \ Hz$.

 The spectrum below shows the hydrogen emission lines from two stars in a binary star system when they are at maximum red/blueshift. It takes 27.169 years for the spectra to look exactly like this again. Based on spectral typing, Star 1 is an $O9V$ star and Star 2 is an $M0I$ star. Use this and the data available at [this website](https://sites.uni.edu/morgans/astro/course/Notes/section2/spectraltemps.html) to perform the following calculations. You may assume that $T_\Sun = 5800 \ K$ and the inclination of the system is $90\degree$. 
 
 ![[Pasted image 20211207130236.png]]
 
 - a) Calculate the radius of both stars (in $R_\Sun$).
 - b) Calculate the masses of both stars (in $M_\Sun$).
 - c) Calculate the semi-major axis of each star's orbit (in $AU$).
 - d) If Star 1 (the $O9V$ star) is producing energy via the $p$-$p$ chain, calculate how many $kg$ of hydrogen it consumes per second (*i.e.* not the 'missing mass', but the amount of $H$ converted to $He$).
 - e) If we assume that stars begin with $100\%$ hydrogen, and that a star evolves off the main sequence when it consumes $10\%$ of its initial hydrogen mass, calculate the main sequence lifetime of Star 1 (in years). Compare to the sun's main sequence lifetime.
 - f) If stars did not produce energy via the $p$-$p$ chain, but instead simply converted mass to energy with $100\%$ efficiency, how much mass (in $kg$) would Star 1 have to consume per second? What would its MS lifetime be (in years) in this energy generation scenario?

***

**a)**

We can determine the radius of the stars in terms of $R_\Sun$ by using the following relations:

$$F=\sigma T^4 \qq{} L=F(4\pi R^2) \implies L = (\sigma \  T^4 )\ 4\pi R^2 \implies R = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4 \pi \sigma \ T^4}}.$$

Therefore:

## $$\frac{R}{R_\Sun} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{L}{4 \pi \sigma \ T^4}}}{\sqrt{\frac{L_\Sun}{4 \pi \sigma \ T_\Sun^4}}}.$$

The resource above gives the following values for the $O9V$ star:

- $L = 55,000 \ L_\Sun$
- $T = 37,800 \ K$

Substituting these values into the above equation:

## $$\frac{R}{R_\Sun} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{55,000 \ L_\Sun}{4 \pi \sigma \ (37,800)^4}}}{\sqrt{\frac{L_\Sun}{4 \pi \sigma \ (5800)^4}}} = 5.52 R_\Sun.$$

The second star, the $MOI$ star, has the following values:

- $L = 50,600 L_\Sun$
- $T = 3660 \ K.$

Using the same process:

## $$\frac{R}{R_\Sun} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{50,600 \ L_\Sun}{4 \pi \sigma \ (3660)^4}}}{\sqrt{\frac{L_\Sun}{4 \pi \sigma \ (5800)^4}}} = 565.0 R_\Sun.$$

**b)**

To determine the masses of the two stars, we will need to find their velocity via their observed Doppler shifts. For the first and second stars respectively, the Doppler shifts $Z$ are:


$$Z_{O9V} = \frac{\DD \ll}{\ll_0} = \frac{0.067666717}{656.3} = 1.031033 \times 10^{-4}.$$

$$Z_{MOI} = \frac{\DD \ll}{\ll_0} = \frac{0.024930649}{656.3} = 3.798666 \times 10^{-5}.$$

We can now use these Doppler shifts to determine the velocity of each star using the  Doppler effect formula:

$$v = c Z.$$

For the first star:

$$v_1 = c \ (1.031033 \times 10^{-4})= 30909.6 \ m/s.$$

Since this velocity is much less than the speed of light, the non-relativistic approximation is appropriate. 

For the second star:

$$v_2 = c \ (3.798666 \times 10^{-5}) = 11,388.1 \ m/s.$$

Since the inclination of the system is $90\degree$, these measured velocities are exclusively radial velocities. We can utilize these velocities and Kepler's 2nd Law to find the combined total mass of the binary system:

$$\begin{align}(m_1 + m_2) &= \frac{T}{2 \pi G}(v_1 + v_2)^3  \\[2ex] &= \frac{(27.169 \cdot 365.25 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600)}{2 \pi G}(30909.6+11388.1)^3 \\[2ex] &= 1.5618 \times 10^{32} \ kg .\end{align}$$

Keeping in mind that the orbital period must be the same for both stars, we can write:

$$\frac{2 \pi a_1}{v_1} = T = \frac{2 \pi a_2}{v_2}$$

...which implies...

$$\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{30909.6}{11388.1} = 2.7142.$$

Therefore, $m_2 = 2.7142 \ m_1.$

Since the total mass of both stars is $1.5618 \times 10^{32} \ kg$, we can determine the mass of star 1:

$$(m_1 + m_2) = (m_1 + 2.7142 \ m_1) = 3.7142 \ m_1 = 1.5618 \times 10^{32} \ kg$$

$$m_1 = \frac{1.5618 \times 10^{32} \ kg}{3.7142} = 4.1289 \times 10^{31} \ kg = 20.9355  \ M_\Sun.$$

Therefore:

$$m_2 = 2.7142 m_1 = 56.8232 \ M_\Sun.$$


**c)**

Above, we made use of the relation:

$$\frac{2 \pi a_1}{v_1} = T = \frac{2 \pi a_2}{v_2}$$

With the velocities known, we can rearrange this to solve for the semimajor axes $a_1$ and $a_2$:

$$a_1 = \frac{T \ v_1}{2 \pi} = 4.21512 \times 10^{12} \ m = 28.1755 \ AU.$$

$$a_2 = \frac{T \ v_2}{2 \pi} = 1.55299 \times 10^{12} \ m = 10.3811 \ AU.$$


**d)**

Assuming that Star 1 generates energy using the $p$-$p$ chain, we have the energy generation mechanism:

$$^1\text{H} \ + \ ^1\text{H} \ + \ ^1\text{H} \ + \ ^1\text{H} \to \ ^4\text{He} + \nu + \nu + E.$$

Since the masses of the electrons in the four hydrogen atoms can be treated as negligible, the mass on the left side of this process is equal to that of 4 protons, which is $m_i = 6.69408\times10^{-27}\text{ kg}.$ 

The mass of $^4\text{He}$ is $m_f = 6.6466\times10^{-27}\text{ kg}.$ Therefore:

$$\DD m = m_i - m_f = 4.78\times 10^{-29}\text { kg}.$$

We can then relate this to the amount of energy produced in the above reaction:

$$E = \DD m \ c^2 = (4.78\times 10^{-29}) \ c^2 = 4.26729\times10^{-12} \ J = 26.6325 \ \text{ MeV}.$$

This is the energy produced for every 4 hydrogen atoms - we can use this in combination with the mass of the 4 hydrogen atoms to determine the ratio of energy produced per kilogram of hydrogen (the *yield*):

$$\text{yield} = \frac{E}{4m_H}=\frac{4.26729\times10^{-12} \ J}{6.69408\times10^{-27}\text{ kg}} = 6.37472 \times 10^{14} \text{ J/kg}. $$

So in order to produce its luminosity of $L_{O9V}=55000  L_\Sun$, Star 1 would need to burn:

$$\text{rate of fuel consumption} = \frac{L_{O9V}}{\text{yield}} = \frac{55000 \ L_\Sun}{6.37472 \times 10^{14} \text{ J/kg}} = 3.30273 \times 10^{16}\text{ J/kg} $$

of hydrogen.

**e)**

If a star evolves off the main sequence when it consumes $10\%$ of its initial hydrogen supply, we can use the rate found above to determine the main sequence lifetime of Star 1:

$$\text{lifetime} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}m_1}{\text{rate of fuel consumption}} = \frac{0.1 (4.1289 \times 10^{31} \ kg)}{3.30273 \times 10^{16}} = 1.25015 \times 10^{14} \ s = 3.964 \times 10^6 \text{ years}.$$

The Sun's main sequence lifetime is approximately 10 billion years, so this star will move off the sequence long before the Sun does.

**f)**

If mass was directly converted to energy with $100\%$ efficiency, the energy generation mechanism is purely given by $E=mc^2$. Using this to determine the yield as before:

$$\text{yield} = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{m \ c^2}{m} = c^2 \text{ kg/s}.$$

We can use this now to find the rate at which the star must burn to maintain its given luminosity:

$$\text{rate of fuel consumption} = \frac{L_{O9V}}{\text{yield}} = 2.343 \times 10^{14} \text{ kg/s}.$$

Since the energy generation process is more efficient, less hydrogen must be burnt per second to maintain the same luminosity.

We can repeat our above work to find the main sequence lifetime of the star with this energy generation mechanism:

$$\text{lifetime} = \frac{m_1}{\text{rate of fuel consumption}} = \frac{4.16289 \times 10^{31} \text{ kg}}{343 \times 10^{14} \text{ kg/s}} = 1.77706 \times 10^{17} \text{ s} = 5.63483 \times 10^9 \text{ years}.$$

With this mechanism of energy generation, the star's main sequence lifetime is just over half that of the Sun's.

# 3. 

High-resolution observations of the center of our galaxy (distance $= 8.5 \ kpc$) show stars within $\approx 0.1\text{"}$ of the galactic center that are orbiting an invisible object. The $H\aa$ spectrum ($\ll_0 = 656.6 \ nm$) of one of these stars shows a doppler shift of $\DD \ll = 1.6415 \ nm$, and the motion in the plane of the sky (*i.e.* proper motion) of $0.05\text{"}$ between Jan. 1, 1994 and Jan. 1, 1996. 

- a) If the star is $0.13\text{"}$ from the center of mass, calculate the mass of the invisible central object (in $M_\Sun$) assuming that the orbit is circular.
- b) Subsequent long-term observations show that on Jan. 1, 1997, the star is at the aphelion position in its orbit ($0.2169\text{"}$ from the center of mass) and a few years later, on Aug. 9, 2004, the star is at its perihelion distance ($0.0141\text{"}$ from CM). Calculate the eccentricity of the star's orbit and calculate a revised mass for the central object (in $M_\Sun$).
- c) Recent measurements from the Event Horizon telescope yield an angular diameter of this object of $20 \ \mu as$. Calculate the maximum radius of this object (in $AU$) and the minimum escape velocity from the surface of the object (in $km/s$). Based on your calculations, speculate on what the central object could be. 

***
**a)**

First, let's use the given angular distance of the star from the CM to find the linear orbital radius. We can use the small angle approximation:

$$\theta \text{ [rad]} = \frac{r}{D} \implies r = D \theta$$

The distance to the observed star is given as $8.5 \text{ kpc}$, so:

$$\begin{align}r &= 8.5\times10^3 \text{ pc}\ \qty(0.13\text{"}\cdot \frac{1'}{60\text{"}}\cdot\frac{1\degree}{60'}\cdot\frac{\pi \text{ rad}}{180\degree})\\ &= 5.35719 \text{ pc} \\ &= 1.65306\times10^{11} \text{ km} \\ &= 1105 \text{ AU from the CM}.\end{align}$$

In order to find the mass of the objects, we will need to determine the star's velocity. Using the Doppler shift formula:

$$Z = \frac{\DD \ll}{\ll_o} = \frac{1.6415}{656.6} = 0.0025.$$

The nonrelativistic Doppler Effect should be appropriate, since it won't give us a speed exceeding $c$:

$$v = Z c = 749,481\text{ m/s}.$$

This velocity, however, is only the radial velocity $v_r$: to find the total velocity, we need to consider the tangential velocity $v_T$ as well, which we can find from the proper motion:

$$v_T = 4/74 \  ( \mu\text{ ["/yr] }\cdot D \text{ [pc]}).$$

Using the given distance of $8.5\times10^3$ pc, and noting that since the star moves 0.05" in two years, the proper motion $\mu$ will be 0.025"/yr, we find:

$$\begin{align} v_T &= 4.74 \  \mu \cdot D \\ &= 4.74 (0.025) \ (8.5 \times 10^3)\\ &= 1007.25\times10^3 \text{ m/s}.  \end{align}$$

Therefore the total velocity of the star is:

$$v = \sqrt{v_r^2 + v_T^2} = 1.2555\times10^6 \text{ m/s}.$$

Assuming that the orbit is stable and circular, we can use Newton's law of gravitation to determine the mass of the unknown object:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}},$$

where $M$ is the mass of the unknown object and $R$ is the orbital distance (found earlier to be $1105$ AU or $1.65306\times10^{11} \text{ km}$). We assume the mass of the orbiting star is negligible. Rearranging to solve for $M$:

$$\begin{align} M &= \frac{v^2 \ R}{G}\\ &= \frac{(1.2555\times10^6 \text{ m/s})^2(1.65306\times10^{14} \text{ m})}{G} \\ &= 3.90406\times10^{36} \text{ kg} \\ &= 1.96338\times10^6 \ M_\Sun.\end{align}$$

Given this incredibly large mass, we can conclude that the unidentified object is a supermassive black hole. 

**b)**

Using the new measurements, we can repeat the process in the previous step to find the star's distance at aphelion and perihelion. Converting the angles in arcseconds to radians, we find:

$$\begin{align} r_\text{aphelion} &= D  \theta = (8.5 \times 10^3)\cdot (1.05156\times10^{-6}) = 0.0089383 \text{ pc} = 2.75806\times10^{14} \ m. \\[2ex] r_\text{perihelion} &= D\theta= (8.5 \times 10^3)\cdot (6.83587\times10^{-8}) = 0.000581 \text{ pc} = 1.79278\times10^{13}\ m.  \end{align}$$

Both the aphelion and perihelion distances can be related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $\epsilon$ by the relations:

$$r_\text{aphelion} = a (1+\epsilon) \qq{} r_\text{perihelion} = a(1-\epsilon)$$

Rearranging these two formulae, we can eliminate the semi-major axis to produce the following equation:

$$\frac{r_\text{aphelion}}{(1+\epsilon)}= \frac{r_\text{perihelion}}{(1-\epsilon)}.$$

Solving this equation numerically for $\epsilon$ gives an eccentricity:

$$\epsilon = 0.877928.$$

With the eccentricity known, we can substitute it back into either of the two relations above to determine the semi-major axis:

$$r_\text{aphelion} = a (1+\epsilon) \implies a = \frac{r_\text{aphelion}}{(1+\epsilon)} = \frac{2.75806\times10^{14} \ m}{1.877928} = 1.46863\times10^{14} \ m.$$

Noting that there are 2777 days between the measurement of the perihelion and aphelion^[Found via https://www.timeanddate.com/date/duration.html], we can conclude that the orbital period must be twice that duration, giving a value for $T$ of $5554$ days or $15.2164$ years.

If we convert $a$ to $AU$:

$$1.46863\times10^{14} \ m = 981.966 \ AU$$

...we can make use of Kepler's Third Law to revise our calculated mass for the black hole: 
$$M \ T^2 = a^3 \implies M = \frac{a^3}{T^2}.$$

This equation assumes that $T$ is given in years, $a$ in $AU$, and will yield the mass $M$ in solar masses $M_\Sun$. 

$$= \frac{(981.966 \ AU)^3}{15.2164^2} = 4.08945 \times 10^6 \ M_\Sun.$$

**c)**

We can convert the angular size to linear size similarly to before - since the angle is so small, we'll use the small angle approximation (converting the angle to radians):

$$R = D \ \theta \text{ [rad]} = (8.5\times10^3)(9.69627\times10^{-11}) = 8.24183\times10^{-7} pc = 2.5432\times10^{10} \ m.$$

The radius of the object is thus $R/2 = 1.27161\times10^{10} \ m.$

We now have enough information to calculate the escape velocity for the star using the escape velocity formula:

$$v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_0}} = \sqrt{\frac{2G(4.08945 \times 10^6 \ M_\Sun)}{2.5432\times10^{10} }}= 2.92169 \times10^8 \text{ m/s}= 0.97457 \ c.$$

The escape velocity is very nearly the speed of light. Since the escape velocity of a black hole's event horizon is exactly $c$, we can conclude that this object is indeed a supermassive black hole, and the difference in escape velocity (theoretical vs. calculated) may be due to rounding error.

Using both radial velocity and stellar transit data, you determine that a distant star has a planet orbiting around it. The radial velocity and light curves are shown below:
![[Pasted image 20211206122732.png]]
Given the spectral type of this star ($G0V$), and assuming that the inclination of the orbit is $90 \degree$:

- a) Calculate the planet's mass (in units of Earth mass $M_\Earth = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \ kg$) and semi-major axis of its orbit (in $AU$).
- b) Using the orbital velocity information, calculate the radius of the planet (in units of $R_\Earth = 6400 \ km$), the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the planet(in $m/s^2$), and the radius of the star (in $R_\Sun$). Compare to the stellar radius you obtain from the luminosity & temperature information. Assume $T_\Sun = 5800 \ K$. 
- c) Calculate the temperature of the planet (in $K$ and $\degree C$). Assume that the planetary surface area that intercepts the stellar radiation is $\pi R^2$, where $R$ is the planetary radius. Then assume that $80\%$ of this energy is absorbed, and that the planet then radiates the same amount of energy back into space as a spherical black body of temperature $T$. Based on this, determine whether the planet is in the "Goldilocks Zone".

***
**a)**

Assuming that the mass of the star $m_2$ >> the mass of the planet $m_1$, we can use the following relation to determine the mass of the planet:
$$m_1^3 \approx \frac{V_2^3 \ T}{2 \pi G} m_2^2$$

where $V_2$ is the velocity of the planet and $T$ is the orbital period, which were given as $0.047 \  m/s$ and $313.53$ days, respectively. We are told the star is a $G$ type star, so we can assume the mass $m_2 \approx 2\times10^{30} \text{ kg}$.^[Taken from class slides, Part 7 - Celestial Mechanics, Slide 51. ] Thus:


$$m_1^3 = \frac{(0.047)^3 (313.53 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600)}{2 \pi G}(2\times10^{30})^2 = 2.68283 \times 10^{73} \ kg^3$$

$$\implies m_1 = \root {3} \of {2.68283 \times 10^{73} \ kg^3} = 2.993585\times10^{24} \ kg = 0.50 M_\Earth.$$

We can find the semi-major axis of the planet by noting that the distance $R$ between the objects is given by: 

$$R = \frac{V_2 T}{2\pi}\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_1} \approx \frac{V_2 T}{2\pi}\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{(0.047)(313.53 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600)}{2\pi}\frac{2\times10^{30}}{2.993585\times10^{24}}=5.84215 \times10^9 m$$

$$=0.0390514 \ AU.$$

We can relate this distance $R$ to the semi-major axis of the star using by recalling that:

$$R = a_1 + a_2 = a_2(\frac{a_1}{a_2}+1) = a_2 \qty(\frac{m_2}{m_1}+1)$$


Filling in our values for the masses, we find that:

$$0.0390514 \ AU = a_2 \qty(\frac{2.0 \times 10^{30}}{2.993585\times10^{24}}+1) \implies a_2 = \frac{0.0390514 \ AU}{\qty(\frac{2.0 \times 10^{30}}{2.993585\times10^{24}}+1)} = 5.8451\times10^{-8} \ AU.$$

This is such a small value that we can assume the center of mass lies within the star. We can now find $a_1$ easily:

$$a_1 = R - a_2 \approx 0.03905 \ AU. $$

The semi-major axis is effectively identical to the orbital distance of the planet. 

**b)**


We can make use of the stellar transit data to determine the radius of the planet. Note that the distance the planet moves between $t_1$ and $t_2$ in the figure above corresponds to one planetary diameter - this distance is given by 

$$d=V\DD t = V(t_2-t_1)$$

...thus, the radius of the planet will be given by:

$$r = d/2 = \frac{1}{2} V(t_2-t_1).$$

The velocity $V$ in the above equation is the orbital velocity, equal to $v=\frac{2 \pi \ a_1}{T}$, so the final formula for the planet's radius becomes:


$$\begin{align}r &= \frac{\pi a_1}{T}(t_2 - t_1) \\[2ex] &= \frac{\pi (0.03905 \ AU)}{(313.53 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600)}(7.98 \cdot 60) \\[2ex] &= 0.0000502474 \ AU \\ &= 7.5169 \times 10^6 m \\ &= 1.17986 R_\Earth.	\end{align}$$

The centripetal acceleration due to gravity is given by Newton's law of gravitation:

$$a_c = -\frac{GM}{R^2} = -3.53602 \ m/s^2$$

where $M$ is the mass of the planet, $R$ is the radius of the planet, and the negative sign in front of the acceleration simply indicates the direction of the acceleration is radially inwards. 

Finally, we can find the radius of the star in a similar manner to how we calculated the radius of the planet -  the planet transits the star between times $t_2$ and $t_3$, but the distance traveled by the center of the planet will be the distance the planet moves through that time interval, *plus* another $2R$, as per the figure. So repeating the previous calculation for the star, with that slight variation:

$$\begin{align} R_\text{star} &= v \DD t + 2R \\[2ex] &= \frac{ \pi a_1}{T}(t_3-t_2) + 2R \\[2ex] &= \frac{ \pi (0.03905 \ AU)}{(313.53 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600)}(43231.8 \ s) + 2(0.03905 \ AU) \\[2ex] &= 0.99633 R_\Sun. \end{align}$$

This is a reasonable conclusion, since our Sun is also a G type star, and they should be roughly the same size. Using the luminosity data and temperature from the website given above, we can also set up a relation for the radius of the star:

$$R_\text{star} = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4 \pi \sigma T^4}} = \sqrt{\frac{ L_\Sun}{4 \pi \sigma (5800)^4}} =  0.990469 R_\Sun. 
$$

The two radii agree very well with each other.

Modeling the planet as a blackbody, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

$$F = \sigma T^4$$ 

to determine the temperature. However, the only 80% of the energy is absorbed and reemitted by the planet, so we need to reflect this.

The planetary surface area receiving radiation is $\pi R^2 = 1.77512 \times 10^{14} \ m^2$. The luminosity of the star is the same as that of the sun, $L = L_\Sun$, so we can write:

$$L = 4 (0.8) \ (1.77512 \times 10^{14}) \sigma T^4$$



remembering to add the factor of 0.8, and solving this equation for temperature, we find:

$$T = \qty(\frac{L}{(0.8) \ 4 \pi \sigma \ (1.353 783 \times 10^{11})^2})^{1/4} = 457.916 \ K = 184.916 \degree C.$$



Since the Goldilocks Zone is the range in which liquid water may exist on the surface of a planet, this unnamed planet is not likely to be inside, as the temperature is too high for water to remain in liquid state.
