For $\ce{BaCl2}$, the absolute magnitude of the difference in electronegativity $\DD\chi$ is $3.0 (\ce{Cl}) -$ $0.9 \ (\ce{Ba}) = 2.1$. This value implies that the bond between the $\ce{Ba}$ and $\ce{Cl}$ atoms are ionic bonds, forming $\ce{Ba^2+}$ and two $\ce{Cl-}$ ions. 


For $\ce{KN3}$, the $\DD\chi$ between potassium and nitrogen is $3.0-0.8 = 2.2$, so the potassium will form a cation and one of the nitrogens will form an anion, and an ionic bond will form. For the remaining nitrogen atoms, the atoms are identical, the $\DD\chi$ is $0$, and the nitrogens will be bonded together with pure covalent bonds.


For $\ce{CH2NH}$, the carbon and hydrogens have $\DD \chi = 0.4$, so they will form pure covalent bonds. The carbon and nitrogen have $\DD \chi=0.5$, so they will also form a pure covalent bond.  The nitrogen and hydrogens have $\DD \chi=0.9$, forming highly polar covalent bonds.
