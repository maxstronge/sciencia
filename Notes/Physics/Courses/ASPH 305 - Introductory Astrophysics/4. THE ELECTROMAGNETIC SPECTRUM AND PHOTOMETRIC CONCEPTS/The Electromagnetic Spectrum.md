# The Electromagnetic Spectrum:

***

We have covered the wave-particle duality of light extensively in [[3.2 - The Photoelectric Effect]]. When talking about subatomic effects in this course, we will tend to model light as being made of particles called **photons**. Recall some important points:

- Photons travel through space at the speed of light ($c = 3\times10^8\,m/s$)
- This is the fastest attainable speed in the univrs
