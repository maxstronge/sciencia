If the curl of a vector field $\mathbf{F}$ vanishes everywhere, then $\mathbf{F}$ can be written as the gradient of a **scalar potential** ($V$):

$$\curl \mathbf{F} = 0 \iff \mathbf{F} = -\nabla V.$$

The minus sign, mathematically, is purely conventional, but there are physical implications in electrodynamics. 

**Theorem 1:**
	Curl-less (or **irrotational**) fields. The following conditions are equivalent (*i.e.* a function $\mathbf{F}$ satisfies one iff it satisfies them all):
		**1.** $\curl \mathbf{F}=0$ everywhere.
		**2.** $\int^{b}_{a}\mathbf{F}\cdot d \mathbf{l}$ is independent of path for any given endpoints.
		**3.** $\oint \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{l}=0$ for any closed loop.
		**4.** $\mathbf{F}$ is the gradient of some scalar function: $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla V$.     ^0540e0
