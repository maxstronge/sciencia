# Currents:
***

The **current** in a moving wire is the *charge per unit time* passing a given point. By definition, negative charges moving to the left (such as electrons) counts the same as positive ones going to the right. This conveniently reflects the physical fact that almost all phenomena involving moving charges depend on the *product* of charge and velocity - if one reverses the signs on both $q$ and $v$, the result is unchanged. 

Current is measured in Coulombs-per-second, or **amperes** ($A$).
