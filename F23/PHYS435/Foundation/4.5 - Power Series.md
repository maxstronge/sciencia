A **power series** has the form:

$$
P(x) = a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3}+\dots
$$
where $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2}\dots$ are constants. Series of this kind very regularly appear in physics - this is useful because for $|x|<1$, the later terms in the series often become very small and can be discarded.
