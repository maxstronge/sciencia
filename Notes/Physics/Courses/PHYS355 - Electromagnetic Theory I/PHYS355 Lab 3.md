The plotted function has a high degree of linearity, with an $R^2$ value of 0.9997. The error bars were small on the horizontal axis and negligible on the vertical axis, indicating that the measurements are a good reflection of the true relationship between the quantities. 

Dividing the slope by $K$, we find a value for e/m:

$$\frac{e}{m} = 1.91 \times 10^{11} \pm 1.7\times10^9.$$

## Discussion:



The experimentally agreed-upon value for $\frac{e}{m}$ is $\approx1.75 \times10^{11}$, giving us an $8.58671\%$ margin  of error. Our derivation matches the experimentally determined value to high precision, so our value supports the standard.

Several sources of uncertainty were present in this experiment, including:

- imperfect alignment of the Helmoltz coil to magnetic North
- measurement uncertainty in ruler (diameter measurement)
- Imprecise measurement of the diameter of the electron beam (spread of values) visual distortion of glass bulb
- Distortion of values due to background magnetic fields (geomagnetic field, several electronic devices on table)



We find the expected terminal velocity:

$$\begin{align}v &= 	\sqrt{2\frac{e}{m}V} 	 \\ &= \sqrt{2(1.91\times10^{11})(300)} \\ &=10705138.9529 \text{ m/s} \\ &= 1.07051 \times10^7\text{ m/s}\end{align}$$



The terminal velocity calculated using the experimental value of e/m is $1.07\times 10^7$ m/s. If we instead use the actual value, we have $1.03 \times 10^7$ m/s.


Voltage needed to accelerate to relativistic speeds: 
$$2.539\text{ kV}.$$

The classical law of conservation of energy is preserved with this velocity as the speed does not reach relativistic speeds (speed is only about 3-4% of the speed of light) - if it were moving at relativistic speeds, we may expect to see a much brighter, more prominent electron beam due to the higher energy of the electrons.
