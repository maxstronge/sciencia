# 7.4 - Radial Probability Densities: 

***

Instead of asking about the [[7.3 - The Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions|complete probability density]] of the electron, we may want to examine the probability to find the electron at a *particular distance from the nucleus*, regardless of the values of $\theta$ and $\phi$.

In other words, consider a thin spherical shell of radius *r* and thickness $dr$. What is the probability of finding the electron between shells of radius $r$ and $r+dr$?

We define the **radial probability density** $P(r)$ such that the probability to find the electron within that shell is $P(r)dr$. We can determine the radial probability from the [[7.3 - The Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions#^607e82|complete probability]] by integrating over the $\theta$ and $\phi$ coordinates. In effect, this sums all the probabilities for the volume elements at a given *r* *for all $\theta$ and $\phi$*:

> ### $$P(r)dr = \vert R_{n,l}(r)\vert ^2r^2\;dr\;\int_0^\pi \vert \Theta_{l,m_l}(\theta)\vert^2 \sin(\theta)\;d\theta \;\int_0^{2\pi}\vert \Phi_{m_l}(\phi)\;d\phi.$$

Luckily, the $\theta$ and $\phi$ integrals each evaluate to 1, because each of the functions $R,\,\Theta$, and $\Phi$ are **individually normalized**. Thus, the radial probability density reduces to:

> ## $$P(r)=r^2 \vert R_{n,l}(r)\vert^2. $$

Plotted below are the radial probability densities for several of the lowest levels of hydrogen:

Note that, because of the $r^2$ factor, $P(r)$ must be zero at $r=0$ even if $R(R)$ might not be. That is, the probability to locate the electron in a spherical shell always goes to zero as $r \to 0$ because *the volume of the shell goes to zero*, but the probability density $\vert\psi\vert^2$ may be nonzero at $r = 0$. 

Moreover, $P(r)$ and $\vert R(r)\vert2$ convey different information about the electron's behaviour, as you can see by comparing the above figure with [[7.3 - The Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions#^6ed731|plots of the full probability density.]]

Using the radial probability densities, it is possible to find **the average value of the radial coordinate** - that is, the average distance between the proton and the electron. 

It appears from these graphs that the average radius depends mostly on *n* and not very much on *l*. The **principal quantum number** *n* thus determines not only the energy level of the electron, it also determines to a great extent the *average distance of the electron from the nucleus.*

## Example - Finding Radial Probabilities

>For the $n = 2$ states $(l = 0$ and $l = 1$), compare the probabilities
of the electron being found inside the Bohr radius.

...

For the $n=2$ state, there are two permissible values of *l*:  $l=0$ and $l=1$.

Starting with the first state, (*2,0*), we can find the [[Table of Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions|radial equation from our table:]]

>$$\begin{align}
 P(r) \,dr & = r^2\vert R_{2,0}(r)\vert^2\,dr \\ &=r^2\frac{1}{8a^3_0}\left( 2 - \frac{r}{a_0} \right)^2e^{-r/a_0} \,dr.\\
 \end{align}$$

 
 To find the total probability, we just need to integrate $P(r)$ from $r=0$ and $r=a_0$:
 
 > ## $$P(0:a_0)=\int_0^{a_0}P(r)\,dr $$
 > ## $$=\frac{1}{8a_0^3}\int_0^{a_0}\left( 4r^2 -\frac{4r^3}{a_0} + \frac{r^4}{a^2_0}\right)e^{-r/a_0} \;dr.$$

This integral should be [[7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom#^9fc080|familar]] -  using that general form to evaluate it, we find that:

> ## $$P(0:a_0)= 0.034. $$
