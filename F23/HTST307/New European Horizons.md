- Western Roman empire ended ~476CE (Barbarian overrun)
- Eastern Roman empire (i.e. Byzantine empire, orthodox greek/Christian) ends 1453CE with the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks
- After last vestiges of W. Roman Empire vanish in the 5th century, there is a long evolution form patchwork 'barbarian' feudal networks to stronger centralized monarchies / proto-states
- Nominal hierarchy, not very defined borders, quite confusing (this is especially bad in Central Europe all the way to the 15th century)
- Transactional relationships building - service for land, building feudalism

- From ~1300CE (late middle ages) to ~1700CE, there were a number of transformational changes that took place in Europe that underpin a lot of what we refer to as 'modernity' 
- The Renaissance ('rebirth') takes place in a very tense environment - fractured Europe, lots of political/military tensions building


## The Middle Ages

- The 'Medieval' period - c.478-1500CE (fall of W. Rome to fall of Byzantium)
- 'Early Modern' period - c.1500-1815CE (fall of Byzantine empire to lead-in to Industrial Revolution)
- 'Modern' era is 1815CE onwards

- Highly hierarchical/segregated society 


1.  The clergy (religious figures/administration, the 'first estate')
		- 'those who pray'
		- Primarily the Catholic Church
		- Various monastic orders, some public-facing, some not
		
2. The aristocracy (nobility, temporal political powers)
		- 'those who fight' - knights etc, primary military class
		- warrior-aristocracy - defend the land they hold (and draw rent from)
		- are expected to provide military service proportional to the amount of land one owns


3. The peasantry 
		- 'those who work'
		- ~85% of the population


- **Feudalism** - system of mutual obligation (social contract) between lords (elites) and vassals (lords/lesser nobility) to run a manorial system

- King owns all the land in the manor/kingdom (nominally), distributes rights to lesser nobility as appropriate - network of patronage can become quite complicated

- Towns/cities/urbanites were not really a clear part of this order - mayors elected by the big property-owners of the town - at this point a tiny tiny percent of the population is living in towns/urban centers (i.e. London ~1400) - lack of representation in society for this class

- Towns were not controlled directly by feudal aristocrats (semi-autonomous zone) 

- Guilds were operative in town, controlling/regulation body for a certain industry (metallurgy, woodworking, etc)


## Christendom:

- Islamic conquests in the 7th century (knocked out 3/5 of original bishoprics, in Jerusalem, Antiochin, Alexandria)
- Made Europe into a divided Christian community (only 2 bishops remaining, Rome and Constantinople - had a schism leading to the separation of Orthodox Christianity and mainstream roman Catholicism)
- Church absolutely central to most people's lives (more so than secular political authorities) - 'parallel power structure' - parish, priest, bishop, archbishop, cardinal, etc
- Church owns land - up to 1/3 of the land in some cases, owned manors
- Followed fragmented Greco-Roman orthodoxies - emphasized Christian 'otherworldliness' (focus on the separation between physical suffering on Earth and the 'real' life in Heaven), theology, virtue


## Evolution of Medieval Europe

- many crises in the 14th century driving change in Europe
- papal crisis reduces legitimacy of the pope
- Bubonic plague/black death kills a stupid number of people, -> labor shortage -> employee market
- Feudal monarchy becoming more centralized
