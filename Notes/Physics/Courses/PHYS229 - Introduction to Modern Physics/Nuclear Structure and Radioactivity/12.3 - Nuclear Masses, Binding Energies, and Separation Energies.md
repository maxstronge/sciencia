# 12.3 - Nuclear Masses and Binding Energies:
***

Suppose we have a proton and an electron at rest separated by a large distance (such that the Coulomb interaction is negligible). The total energy of this system is the total rest energy of the two particles:

>### $$ E = m_p c^2 + m_e c^2. $$

Now we let the two particles come together to form a hydrogen atom in its ground state. In the process, several photons are emitted, the *total* energy of which is 13.6 *eV*. 

The total energy of this system is now the rest energy of the hydrogen atom, *m*(H)$c^2$, plus the total photon energy, 13.6*eV*. Conservation of energy demands that the total energy of the system of isolated particles must equal the total combined energy of the atom and the photons: $m_e c^2 + m_p c^2 = m(H)c^2 + 13.6 eV$, which we write as:

>### $$ m_e c^2 + m_p c^2 - m(H)c^2 = 13.6 eV.$$

That is, the rest energy of the combined system (the hydrogen atom) is less than the rest energy of its constituents (an electron and a proton) by 13.6*eV*.

This energy difference is the **binding energy** of the atom. We can regard the binding energy as either the *"extra energy"* we obtain when we assemble an atom from its components, or alternately, the energy we must *supply* to disassemble the atom into its component particles. 


**Nuclear binding energies** are calculated in a similar way. Consider, for example, the nucleus of deuterium, $_1^2H_1$, which is composed of one proton and one neutron. Analogously to the atomic situation, the nuclear binding energy of deuterium is the *difference* between the *total rest energy of the constituents* and the *rest energy of their combination*:

>### $$B = m_n c^2 + m_p c^2 - m_D c^2... $$

...where $m_D$ is the mass of the deuterium nucleus. To finish the calculation, we can replace the nuclear masses $m_n$ and $m_D$ with the corresponding [[12.3 - Nuclear Masses, Binding Energies, and Separation Energies#m_e c 2 m_p c 2 - m H c 2 13 6 eV|atomic masses]]. First, we can use our previous work for the hydrogen atom to write an expression with the mass of the deuterium nucleus:

>### $$ m(^1 H)c^2 = m_p c^2 + m_e c^2 - 13.6 eV \implies m(^2 H)c^2 = m_D c^2 + m_e c^2 - 13.6 eV.$$

We can then substitute $m_p c^2$ and $m_D c^2$ into [[12.3 - Nuclear Masses, Binding Energies, and Separation Energies#B m_n c 2 m_p c 2 - m_D c 2|our expression for the binding energy]] to find:

>### $$ B = m_n c^2 + [m(^1 H)c^2 - m_e c^2+ 13.6eV] - [m(^2H)c^2 - m_e c^2 + 13.6eV]$$

>### $$= [m_n +m(^1H) - m(^2H)]c^2.$$

The electron mass has canceled in this calculation! For deuterium, we then have:

>### $$B = (1.008665u + 1.007825u - 2.1014102u)\times (931 \frac{MeV}{u})$$
>### $$ = 2.224 MeV.$$

...where we've used $c^2 = 931.5 \frac{MeV}{u}$ to convert mass units to energy units.

We can generalize this process to calculate the binding energy of a nucleus *X* of mass number *A* with *Z* protons and *N* neutrons. 

Let $m_X$ represent the mass of this nucleus. Thus the binding energy is, like we just found, the difference between the nuclear rest energy and the total rest energy of its constituents (*N* neutrons and *Z* protons):

>## $$ B = Nm_n c^2+ Zm_pc^2 - m_Xc^2$$

It is often more convenient, however, to use atomic masses for this calculation rather than nuclear masses, as the atomic masses can easily be looked up in a table. To use the atomic masses, we must replace the nuclear mass $m_X$ with its *corresponding atomic mass*:

>### $$ m(_Z^AX_N)c^2 = m_xc^2+Zm_ec^2-B_e$$

...where **$B_e$** represents the** total binding energy of all the electrons in the atom**.

Nuclear rest energies are of the order ~$10^9$ to ~$10^{11}$ *eV*, and the electron binding energies are of the order of ~1 to ~$10^5$*eV*. Thus, $B_e$ is negligibly small compared to the other two terms, and we can usually be safe in neglecting it without undue loss of accuracy. 

Substituting atomic masses for the nuclear masses $m_p$ and $m_X$, we obtain *an expression for the total binding energy of **any nucleus** * $^A_ZX_N$:

>## $$B = [Nm_n + Zm(_1^1H_0) -m(^A_ZX_N)]\; c^2.$$

The electron masses have again canceled, because on the right side we have the difference between the mass of *Z* hydrogen atoms (with a total of *Z* electrons) and the atom in question of atomic number *Z* (which must also have *Z* electrons.) The masses that appear here are atomic masses (the mass of the isotope has been looked up in a table).

## Proton and Neutron Separation Energies:

If we add the **ionization energy** ($E_i$ = 13.6*eV*) to a hydrogen atom, we obtain a hydrogen ion $H^+$ and a free electron, written as $e^-$. In terms of the rest energies of the particles, we can write this process as:

>### $$ E_i+ m(H)c^2 = m(H^+)c^2 + m_e c^2.$$

If we generalize this to an arbitrary element *X*, this becomes $E_i + m(X)c^2 = m(X^+)c^2 + m_e c^2$, or, as a process equation:

>## $$ X \to X^+ + e^-: \quad E_i = m(X^+)c^2 + m_e c^2 - m(X)c^  = [m(X^+)+m_e-m(X)]\,c^2.$$

 In the case of element *X*, the ionization energy gives 	*the smallest amount of energy necessary to remove an electron from an atom*.
 
 For nuclei, a process similar to ionization consists of *removing the least tightly bound proton or neutron from the nucleus*. The energy required to remove the least tightly bound proton is called the **proton separation energy** $S_p$. If we add energy $S_p$ to some nucleus $_Z^AX_N$, we obtain the nucleus $_{Z-1}^{A-1}X'_N$, and a free proton, *p*. In analogy with the atomic case, we can write the separation process energy as:
 
>## $$ _Z^AX_N \to _{Z-1}^{A-1}X'_N + p: \quad S_p = [m(_{Z-1}^{A-1}X'_N)+m(^1H) - m(_Z^AX_N)]c^2.$$

...using atomic masses. 

Similarly, if we add the **neutron separation energy** $S_n$ to nucleus $_Z^AX_N$, we obtain the nucleus $_Z^{A-1}X_{N-1}$ and a free neutron, *n*:

>### $$ _Z^AX_N \to _Z^{A-1}X_{N-1}: \quad S_n = [m(^{A-1}_ZX_{N-1}) + m_n - m(^A_ZX_N)]\; c^2.$$

Proton and neutron separation energies are usually in the range of ~5-10*MeV*. It is no coincidence that this energy is about the same as the binding energy per nucleon, $\frac{B}{A}$ ! The total binding energy *B* of a nucleus is the energy needed to take it apart into *Z* free protons and *N* free electrons - this energy is the sum of *A* proton and neutron separation energies. 

The proton and neutron separation energies play a role in nuclei similar to that of the ionization energy in atoms.
