- concerned with reviving 'classical' (i.e. Greco-Roman) culture/ideas using the original context of the sources (what does this say about the human condition, politics, etc.)
- begins in wealthy, urbanized, competitive Italian city-states in the 14th century
- begins with Humanism - attributed to Petrach (clerk/writer/poet) - value experiencing/life, wanted to expand literacy/education
- this type of philosophy blended into political theory as well (launched that field) - 'civic humanism' - Niccolo Machiavelli


## The Printing Press

- c. 1450, German craftsman merged a number of disparate technologies (movable type, paper, etc) to create **typography** - massive democratization of knowledge/information (Gutenberg et al)
- Also plays a role in standardizing language
- Was *not* immediately copied by rival civilizations (actually banned in the Ottoman empire, losing monopoly on knowledge, etc)
- Europe is too politically fragmented to stop it

## The Protestant Reformation

- People were growing increasingly dissatisfied with Rome and their religious policies (thru the church)/centralized power by the early 16th century
- Martin Luther wrote a critique of the religious administration (particularly the sale of *indulgences*, like a FastPass for heaven)
- Nailed these 99 points (theses) to the wall of the Wittenberg church, launching a spiritual schism that led to the Protestant Reformation
- At the same time, the church is being dismantled as a parallel power structure by large parts of Europe (in England especially, changing religious law so he could get divorced)
- Printing press accelerates reform and makes it harder to stop - especially in the context of competing military powers (can't get left behind)


## Scientific Revolution:

- Galileo -> Copernicus -> Brahe -> Kepler -> Newton/Leibniz
- Heliocentrism, calculus, gravitation, orbital mechanics (ellipses)
- Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564)
	- Established physical parameters of human body - dissected cadavers (frowned upon)
	- 'father of anatomy'
- Also a revolution in epistemology
	- Francis Bacon (1561-1626) - founder of the modern scientific method (inductive reasoning vs deductive)
- John Locke (1632-1704) - political philosophy, 'blank slate', one of the founding fathers of modern liberalism

## Summary:

- Medieval European society, fragmented and competitive, revived Greco-Roman ideas/learning, extended to all areas of inquiry (political philosophy, scientific revolution, etc)
- These ideas/transformations were driven by innovations in technology (printing press, telescope, microscope, etc)
- Promoted culture of individualism







## The Renaissance and the Origins of Humanism

The Renaissance began as a cultural movement in the 14th century, predominantly in the competitive and wealthy city-states of Italy like Florence, Milan, and Venice. The central concern of this era was the revival of classical Greco-Roman culture and ideas, with a focus on original contexts to understand broader themes such as the human condition, politics, and societal structures. Humanism, attributed to Petrarch—a clerk, writer, and poet—served as the intellectual bedrock of the Renaissance. Petrarch emphasized the value of individual experience and life, advocating for expanded literacy and education as a means to engage directly with classical texts.

This humanistic philosophy was not confined to the arts and literature but extended into political theory, birthing what came to be known as 'civic humanism.' Niccolo Machiavelli, among others, significantly contributed to this field, offering new perspectives on governance, power, and human nature.

## The Printing Press: A Catalyst for Change

Around 1450, a German craftsman named Johannes Gutenberg revolutionized the distribution of knowledge by combining various technologies such as movable type and paper to create typography. The invention not only democratized access to information but also played a role in standardizing language. While the Ottoman Empire banned the technology, fearing a loss of its monopoly on knowledge, Europe's political fragmentation made it impossible to stem the spread of this groundbreaking invention.

## The Protestant Reformation: A Religious Upheaval

By the early 16th century, a growing dissatisfaction with the Roman Catholic Church's centralized power and religious policies became apparent. Martin Luther, a German monk and theologian, crystallized these sentiments when he criticized the sale of indulgences—essentially a 'FastPass' to heaven—in his 95 Theses. Luther famously nailed these theses to the door of the Wittenberg church, setting off a spiritual schism known as the Protestant Reformation. Simultaneously, Europe was dismantling the Church as a parallel power structure, most notably in England, where King Henry VIII changed religious laws to obtain a divorce. The printing press played a pivotal role in accelerating these reforms and making them more resilient against suppression, particularly in the context of competing European military powers.

## The Scientific Revolution: A New Way of Knowing

The Scientific Revolution marked another monumental shift, stringing together the works of great thinkers like Galileo, Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and culminating in the contributions of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The era redefined our understanding of the universe through heliocentrism, calculus, gravitation, and orbital mechanics, among other things. Andreas Vesalius, often termed the 'father of anatomy,' contributed by dissecting human cadavers, despite societal taboos, to establish the physical parameters of the human body.

But the Scientific Revolution was not merely a list of discoveries; it fundamentally changed the way knowledge was acquired. Francis Bacon laid the foundation for the modern scientific method based on inductive reasoning. Similarly, John Locke shifted political philosophy towards modern liberalism with his 'blank slate' theory of human nature. Organizations like the Royal Society, established in 1662, were set up to facilitate scientific collaboration, further accelerating the pace of discovery.
