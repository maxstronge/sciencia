**1. Melting Point Ranges**

Two features that may identify the presence of a meshophase are: a) melting at a lower temperature than predicted, or b) freezing at a higher temperature than expected. This is because the presence of a mesophase widens the range of temperatures over which melting occurs. 

Additionally, one may observe a pearlescent appearance in the melting solid, which is also an indicator of a mesophase.

**2. Acid Chloride Reaction With Water**

Acid chlorides react very violently with water - for example, ethanoyl chloride reacts with water according to the following:

$\ce{CH3COCl} + \ce{H2O} \to \ce{CH3COOH + HCl}$

This reaction is incredbly exothermic, and adding ethanoyl chloride to even very cold water will result in a violent reaction in which hydrogen chloride gas is released. This is very dangerous, and would not be wise to attempt in Experiment 3.

Other acid chlorides will react in a similar manner, with the $\ce{COCl}$ attached to the $\ce{CH3}$ replaced with whatever other group of atoms it may be. 

**3. Expected Appearance of Compound Ester **

Expected appearance: pearlescent (shimmery rainbow)

**4. Complications from Impurity**

If the product is impure, containing non-negligible amounts of some other substance beyond the ester in mesophase, the ability of the LCD to accurately display color will be dramatically hindered. Changing the temperature of the mesophasic ester alters the *helical pitch* of the molecular layers, which corresponds to a unique wavelength of visible light that will be reflected back to an observer. If impurities are mixed into the products, light reflecting off those impurities will not be at such a clearly-defined wavelength, 'muddying' the color observed. 


**5. Potential Hazards**

Hazardous materials include:


*Chemical Hazards (use fume hood):*
- methanol (toxic)
- trimethylamine (toxic)
- excess liquid ester


*Physical Hazards*:
- slides/liquid ester (hot, can burn)
- several glass pieces of equipment (may break causing cuts)
