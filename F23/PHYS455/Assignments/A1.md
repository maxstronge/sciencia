1. The figure below is a panel plot illustrating how using $\vec{E}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\vec{\Delta}E_{i}$ where $\Delta \vec{E}_{i}=\frac{qq_{i}(\vec{r}-\vec{r_{i}})}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}|\vec{r}-\vec{r_{i}}|^{3}}$ , to determine the force on a point charge $q$ due to $N$ other point charges ($q_{1}$ through $q_{N}$) works in practice. Here, $N=5$, and the  location of $q$ is indicated by the black solid circle, and of the five other charges by the red and blue solid circles.



**a.** The blue solid circles have forces directed radially away from the probe charge $q$, and the red circles have a force directed towards $q$, so blue corresponds to positive charges and red to negative per the definition of the electric field.

**b.** The forces $\Delta F_{i}$ are indicated by the grey arrows.

**c.**  The unit vectors are indicated by the small thin black arrows - this is easy to conclude as they are the only vectors that are all the same length

**d.** The net force on $q$ is indicated by the thicker black arrow in the sixth panel, the vector sum of all the grey arrows.

**e**. The separation vectors between $q$ and the charges $q_i$ are indicated by the thin dotted black lines in panels 1 through 5. 


**f.** If $q$ were exchanged for $-q$, the direction of the force exerted by the charges $q_{i}$ on $-q$ would be reversed, and thus the total force would be a vector with equal magnitude in the opposite direction:

**g.** The magnitude of the force due to $q_{1}$ on $q$ is given by 
$$
|\vec{F_{1}}| = \frac{qq_{1}}{|r_{1}-r_{i}|}
$$
where $|r_{1}-r_{i}|$ is the distance between $q_{1}$ and $q$.

For the force due to $q_{2}$ on $q$:

$$
|\vec{F_{2}}| = \frac{qq_{2}}{|r_{2}-r_{i}|}
$$
We can use these expressions to examine the charge ratios - for $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$, we have

$$
\frac{\Delta \vec{F_{1}}}{\Delta \vec{F_{2}}} = \frac{qq_{1}(r_{2}-r_{i})}{qq_{2}(r_{1}-r_{i})} \to \frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}} = \frac{\vec{F_{2}}(r_{2}-r_{i})}{\vec{F_{1}}(r_{1}-r_{i})}.$$

A measurement of the force and separation vectors yields the following ratios:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{q_{2}}{q_{1}} &= \frac{\vec{F_{2}}(r_{2}-r_{i})}{\vec{F_{1}}(r_{1}-r_{i})} = \frac{(1\text{cm})(2.4\text{cm})}{(0.8\text{cm})(2\text{cm})} = 1.5 \\
\frac{q_{3}}{q_{1}} &= \frac{\vec{F_{3}}(r_{3}-r_{i})}{\vec{F_{1}}(r_{1}-r_{i})} = \frac{(0.7\text{cm})(2.2\text{cm})}{(1.6\text{cm}^{2})} = 0.9625 \\

\frac{q_{4}}{q_{1}} &= \frac{\vec{F_{4}}(r_{2}-r_{i})}{\vec{F_{1}}(r_{1}-r_{i})} = \frac{(1.2\text{cm})(2.3\text{cm})}{(1.6\text{cm}^{2})} = 1.725 \\

\frac{q_{5}}{q_{1}} &= \frac{\vec{F_{5}}(r_{5}-r_{i})}{\vec{F_{1}}(r_{1}-r_{i})} = \frac{(1.2\text{cm})(3.2\text{cm})}{(1.6\text{cm}^{2})} = 2.6

\end{align}


$$


2. There is a thin disk of charge, of radius $a$, in the $xy$-plane, centered on the origin. The surface charge density on the disk is $\sigma$, a constant, such that the total charge is $\pi a^{2}\sigma$. Show that the electric field on the z−axis is given by

$$
\vec{E}(z) = E_{z}(z)\hat{\mathbf{z}} = \frac{\sigma \hat{\mathbf{z}}}{2\epsilon_{0}}\left[ \frac{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }-z}{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }} \right] \frac{z}{|z|}
$$


___

Since the disk is centered on the origin, we can see via symmetry that the $x$ and $y$ components of the electric field of the disk will cancel along the $z$-axis, thus $$
\vec{E}(z) = E_{z}(z) \ \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$
and the electric field is entirely oriented in the $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ direction.

We can find the form of the field by considering concentric *rings* of charge, with radius $r$, that contribute some charge $\Delta q$ to the total charge $Q$. We can then integrate the expression for a ring from $r=0$ to $r=a$ to obtain the electric field of the disk.

We start with the electric field $\Delta\vec{E}$ of a thin ring of charge  at a point on the $z$-axis, which has the same symmetry conditions:


$$
\Delta\vec{E}_{z}(z) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{\Delta q \ z}{\left( r^{2}+z^{2} \right)^{3/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$

where $r$ is the inner radius of the ring and $r+\Delta r$ is the outer radius. We do not know $\Delta q$, but we do know the total charge $Q=\pi a^{2}\sigma$, so the charge in the ring must be 
$$\begin{align}
\Delta q &=Q \left(\frac{\text{area of ring}}{\text{area of disk}}\right) \\
&= Q \left(\frac{ 2\pi r \Delta r}{\pi a^{2}} \right)  \\
&=\cancel{ \pi a^{2} }\sigma \left(\frac{ 2\pi r \Delta r}{\cancel{ \pi a^{2} }} \right) \\
&=2\pi\sigma r\Delta r
\end{align}

$$
Returning to the $\vec{E}$ equation:
$$
\Delta\vec{E}_{z}(z) = \frac{1}{4\cancel{ \pi } \epsilon_{0}} \frac{2\cancel{ \pi }\sigma r\Delta r\ z}{\left( r^{2}+z^{2} \right)^{3/2}}\hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$
Putting this into differential form, we can then integrate to find the total contribution of all the disks from radius $0$ to radius $a$:
$$
\begin{align}
dE_{z}(z)&= \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_{0}} \frac{z}{\left( r^{2}+z^{2} \right)^{3/2}}rd r \ \hat{\mathbf{z}}\\ \\


E_{z}(z) &= \frac{\sigma z}{2\epsilon_{0}}\int_{0}^{a} \frac{r}{\left( r^{2}+z^{2} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}} }\,\, dr \,\hat{\mathbf{z}}

\end{align}
$$

where $z$ has been pulled out of the integral at the end because it is the $z$ coordinate of the point we are examining the field at, and is constant for this integral.

We evaluate the integral using a $u$-substitution. The ugliest looking part is the denominator of the integrand, so we'll set 

$$
u=r^{2}+z^{2}
$$
and

$$\frac{du}{dr} =2r \to du = 2r dr \to dr = \frac{1}{2r}du$$
leaving us with

$$
\begin{align}
E_{z}(z) &= \frac{\sigma z}{2\epsilon_{0}}\int_{0}^{a} \frac{1}{2\cancel{ r }}\left( \frac{\cancel{ r }}{u^{\frac{3}{2}}} \right)  \,\hat{\mathbf{z}} \\

\\

&=\frac{\sigma z}{2\epsilon_{0}}\left. \left( \frac{-2}{\sqrt{ u }} \right) \right\rvert^{a}_{0} \\

\\
&=\frac{\sigma z}{4\epsilon_{0}}\left. \left( \frac{-2}{\sqrt{ r^{2}+z^{2} }} \right) \right\rvert^{a}_{0} \\ \\

&= \frac{\sigma z}{2\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{z}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{ a^{2} +z^{2}}} \right)  \\

&= \frac{\sigma \cancel{ z }}{2\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }-z}{\cancel{ z }\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }} \right)  \\

& = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }-z}{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }} \right) \frac{z}{|z|}
\end{align}
$$
where the last term was added to give the direction (negative $z$ will result in the force being directed downwards, towards the disk, whereas positive $z$ will result in upwards force, away from the disk, as expected). Thus:

$$
E_{z}(z)\,\hat{\mathbf{z}} =\frac{\sigma \hat{\mathbf{z}}}{2\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }-z}{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }} \right) \frac{z}{|z|}.
$$

In the limiting case of $|z|≫a$, $a$ becomes negligible compared to $z$, so in the equation for the ring, $(r^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}\approx z^{3}$, and if this is integrated to find the disk as before, we end up with an electric field proportional to $\frac{1}{z^{2}}$, which is the form of the field of a radial point charge. The width of the ring becomes negligible in the limit of large $z$.

$$
E_{z}(z)\,\hat{\mathbf{z}} =\frac{\sigma \hat{\mathbf{z}}}{2\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{\sqrt{ z^{2} }-z}{\sqrt{ a^{2}+z^{2} }} \right) \frac{z}{|z|}
$$

For very very small $|z|≪a$, we have 
$$
E_{z}(z) \approx \frac{\sigma \hat{\mathbf{z}}}{2\epsilon_{0}}\cancel{ \frac{\sqrt{ a^{2} }}{\sqrt{ a^{2} }} }\frac{z}{|z|} =\frac{\sigma \hat{\mathbf{z}}}{2\epsilon_{0}}\frac{z}{|z|} 
$$
..and the dependence on $z$ has vanished entirely, which is the form of an infinite plane of charge.

Q3: 

$\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}\int \rho(\vec{r}) \frac{(\vec{r}-\vec{r'})}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r'}|^{3}} \, d\tau'$

Here we are integrating over the primed variables, and the unprimed $\vec{r}$ is a constant for the integral. We will need to put both $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{r'}$ in terms of Cartesian coordinates:
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{r}&=x \ \hat{\mathbf{x}}+y \ \hat{\mathbf{y}}+z \ \hat{\mathbf{z}} \\
\vec{r'} &= x' \ \hat{\mathbf{x}}+y' \ \hat{\mathbf{y}}+z' \ \hat{\mathbf{z}} 
\end{align}
$$

We can then begin to transform our integrand into Cartesian coordinates:

$$
\begin{align}
(\vec{r}-\vec{r'}) &= (x-x')\hat{\mathbf{x}}+(y-y')\hat{\mathbf{y}}+(z-z')\hat{\mathbf{z}} \\
|\vec{r}-\vec{r'}|^{3}&=\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{3}{2}}
\end{align}
$$

So the curl we need to find is 

$$
\vec{\nabla}\times \left( \rho(x',y',z') \frac{(x-x')\hat{\mathbf{x}}+(y-y')\hat{\mathbf{y}}+(z-z')\hat{\mathbf{z}}}{\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{3}{2}}} \right) 
$$

...where the integral has been dropped as we can interchange taking the curl of the integral and taking the integral of the curl - so we are just interested in the curl of the integrand. 

However, we can make a simplification here - if there is zero charge in the region (i.e. the integral of $\rho(x',y',z')$ over the region of interest is equal to zero), then of course the curl is trivially zero. This is unhelpful, so assume that there is some charge in the region of interest. Then, the only way the curl can be zero is is if the curl of the other term is equal to zero:

$$
\vec{\nabla}\times \left(\frac{(x-x')\hat{\mathbf{x}}+(y-y')\hat{\mathbf{y}}+(z-z')\hat{\mathbf{z}}}{\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{3}{2}}} \right) 
$$

Let's call the term in brackets $\vec{A}$. The curl of a vector function such as $\vec{A}$ can be written 

$$
\vec{\nabla}\times \vec{A} = \left( \frac{ \partial A_{z} }{ \partial y } - \frac{ \partial A_{y} }{ \partial z }  \right)\hat{\mathbf{x}} + \left(  \frac{ \partial A_{x} }{ \partial z } - \frac{ \partial A_{z} }{ \partial x }\right)  \hat{\mathbf{y}} + \left( \frac{ \partial A_{y} }{ \partial x } -\frac{ \partial A_{x} }{ \partial y }  \right) \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$
We will work though one component to demonstrate that it is equal to zero. Identical logic follows for the other components.

We need to find the derivative of the $z$-component of the integrand with respect to $y'$, and vice versa, to determine if the $x$-component of the curl is zero.

$$
(\vec{\nabla}\times A)_{x} = \left( \frac{ \partial A_{z} }{ \partial y } - \frac{ \partial A_{y} }{ \partial z }  \right)
$$
The first term here is 

$$
\frac{ \partial A_{z} }{ \partial y } = \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y } \left[ \frac{(z-z')}{\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{3}{2}}} \right] 
$$
If we rewrite the denominator as $R(y')=\sqrt{  (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} }$:

$$\frac{ \partial A_{z} }{ \partial y' } = \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y' } \left[ \frac{(z-z')}{R^{3}} \right] $$
We use the quotient rule and the chain rule (recalling that $R$ is a function of $y'$)

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{ \partial A_{z} }{ \partial y' } &= \frac{(0\cdot R^{3})-(z-z')\cdot3R^{2} \frac{-(y-y')}{R}}{R^{6}}\\ \\


&= \frac{3(y-y')(z-z')}{R^{5}}  \\
\\
&= \frac{3(y-y')(z-z')}{{\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{5}{2}}}}
\end{align}
 .
$$

Similar logic follows for $\frac{ \partial A_{y} }{ \partial z' }$:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{ \partial A_{y} }{ \partial z' } &= \frac{(0\cdot R^{3})-(y-y')\cdot3R^{2} \frac{-(z-z')}{R}}{R^{6}}\\ \\


&= \frac{3(y-y')(z-z')}{R^{5}}  \\
\\
&= \frac{3(y-y')(z-z')}{{\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{5}{2}}}}
\end{align}
 .
$$

Thus 
$$
\begin{align}
(\vec{\nabla}\times A)_{x} &= \left( \frac{ \partial A_{z} }{ \partial y } - \frac{ \partial A_{y} }{ \partial z }  \right)  \\
\\ 
&= \left( \frac{3(y-y')(z-z')}{{\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{5}{2}}}} - \frac{3(y-y')(z-z')}{{\left[ (x-x')^{2}+(y-y')^{2}+(z-z')^{2} \right]^{\frac{5}{2}}}} \right)  \\

&=0
\end{align}
$$

and the same holds for the other two components of the curl of the integrand.




## Q4:

The following are true:

$\vec{E}(r<a)=-\frac{Qr}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}a^{3}}\hat{r}$

and $\rho(r>a)=0$

where $r=\sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} }$.

What is the total charge?


Start with Gauss' Law in differential form:

$$
\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{E}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}}
$$

The divergence of the electric field, in spherical coordinates, was given in the course notes as

$$
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E}=\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial r }\left( r^{2} E_{r} \right)  
$$

Since our given electric field is exclusively in the radial direction, we can replace $E_{r}$ with the entire magnitude of the electric field:


$$
\begin{align}
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E}&=\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial r }\left( r^{2} \left(-\frac{Qr}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}a^{3}}\right) \right)   \\ \\
&= \frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial r } \left( -\frac{Qr^{3}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}a^{3}} \right)  \\ \\

&= \frac{1}{r^{2}} \left( -\frac{3Qr^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}a^{3}} \right)  \\ \\

&= -\frac{3Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}a^{3}}


\end{align}
$$
Setting this equal to the RHS of Gauss's Law:

$$
\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}}=-\frac{3Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}a^{3}}
$$
$$Q=-\frac{4}{3}\pi a^{3}\rho$$

I.e. the volume of the sphere of radius $a$ multiplied by the charge density, which seems like a sensible result.
