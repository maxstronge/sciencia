# Logical Operators:
***

 **Statement**: a sentence that can be classified as either **true** or **false**.
 
**Implication**: a conditional statement of the form "if *p*, then *q*...". In mathematical notation, this is written as $p \implies 	q$, where *q* is **implied** by *p*. 
 
> For example, the statement "*a square matrix $\bf{A}$ is invertible*" implies that the determinant of $\bf{A}$ is not equal to zero. 

 
> $$\mathit{x}\text{ is even } \implies \frac{x}{2} \in \bf{I}.$$


**Equivalence**: $p \iff q$ is true when both $p \implies q$ and $q \implies p$ are true. 
> $$\bf{A}\text{ is invertible } \implies \det(\bf{A})\neq 0.$$

**Negation**: negation of a statement $p$, denoted as $\sim p$ or $\neg p$, giving $p$ the opposite truth value.
