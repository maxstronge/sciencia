# 8.1 - Introduction to Two-Body Central Force Problems:
***

Let us consider two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$. For the purposes of this section, we assume that they are small enough to be point masses, with no physical extension, whose positions, relative to the origin *O* of some inertial reference frame, are $r_1$ and $r_2$. 	The only forces are the forces $F_{12}$ and $F_{21}$ of their mutual interaction, which we assume to be **conservative** and **central**. Thus, the forces can be derived from a *potential energy*,  $U(r_1,r_2)$. In the case of two astronomical bodies, the force is the *gravitational force*, $Gm_1m_2/\vert r_2 - r_1 \vert^2$, with the corresponding potential energy:

> ## $$U(r_1,r_2) = - \frac{Gm_1m_2}{\vert r_2 - r_1 \vert}. $$

*coulomb* etc

In both of these cases, $U$ depends only on the *difference*, $\vert r_2 - r_1 \vert$, rather than on $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. This is no accident - as we've seen, any **isolated system** is **translationally invariant**, and thus can only depend on the difference between the two terms. 

In the present case, there is a further simplification - because the conservative force is *central*, $U$ is independent of the *direction* of $(r_2 - r_1)$ - it depends only on the magnitude:

> ## $$U(r_1,r_2) = U(\vert r_2 - r_1 \vert). $$

To take advantage of this fact, it is convenient to introduce the new variable:

> ## $$r = r_2 - r_1 $$

This is just the position of $m_1$ relative to $m_2$, and so we refer to *r* as the **relative position**. 

Thus, the potential energy only depends on the magnitude of the relative position:

> ## $$U = U(r). $$

We can now state the mathematical problem that we wish to solve: we want to find the possible motions of two bodies whose **Lagrangians** are:

> ## $$\mathcal L= \frac{1}{2}m_1 \dot r_1^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2 \dot r_2^2 - U(r). $$
