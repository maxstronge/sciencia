# Kernel and Image of Linear Transformations:
***

This section is dedicated to two important subspaces associated with a linear transformation $T: V \to W$. 


The **kernel** of a $T$ (denoted $\ker T$)	and the **image** of $T$ (denoted $\img T$ or $T(V)$) are defined by:

> ### $$\begin{align} \ker T  = \{ \va{v} \in V :T(\va{v}) = \va{0}\} \\[3ex] \img T = \qty{T(\va{v}): \va{v}\in V}=T(V)\end{align} $$

The kernel of $T$ is often called the *nullspace* of $T$ (see [[Image Space and Nullspace|earlier work]]) because it consists of all the vectors $\va{v}$ in $V$ satisfying the *condition* that $T(\va{v}) = 0$. The image of $T$ is often called the *range* of $T$ and consists of all vectors of the *form* $\va{w} = T(\va{v})$ for some $\va{v}$ in $V$.
