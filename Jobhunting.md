About Staffing is not the actual company, they're a hiring firm that will connect you with their client if interested. Urgently hiring a draftsperson to conduct 3D visualization, 2D/3D fabrication design. Reading/interpreting/creating architectural drawings. Needs fluency in AutoCAD, Revit, and SketchUp (!). Plus Office suite, which is a cakewalk. Full salaried position, $65/$75k/yr. Flexible hours, lots of vacation, LOTS of benefits. Not remote, but *super* cool office environment (basketball court, badminton court, full gym, personal trainers provided). Asking for 5-7 years of experience in the industry, but I'm confident we can make a compelling case for you. You do have experience. 

Really like this one but will require some creative resume-writing. Pretty sure we could pull it off.  Urgently hiring!!


### Northern RNA Inc - QC Laboratory Technician
https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Northern-Rna-Inc.?attributionid=adwebapp

Company specializes in the production of nucleic acid products that support life-enabling work. Seems like they want to focus on mRNA tech after it blew up with the covid vaccines. Looking for a tech to do some pretty cool shit, including but not limited to:
- spectrophotometry
- preparation/documentation of reagents, media, buffers, stock
- equipment maintenance/calibration/troubleshooting

 Requires bachelor's degree in biological or chemical sciences, engineering specifically named. Lots of multidisciplinary work. Wants experience with routine analytical techniques, which you have. All the 'soft skills' they're looking for, you have in spades. Salaried (competetive), plus full health/dental/general illness, plus vacation. Not remote, site is in the SE. I like this one tbh.




### Kuva Systems - Digital Imaging Reviewer

Kuva does continuous measurement of methane emissions to generate best practices for emissions reductions (I think, lots of corporate speak without a lot of substance). They do lots of imaging, you have experience. Remote, with the potential of an office if you want. $20-$25 /hr, which means you can get at least $23. Looking for someone to do a lot of data analysis. Part time/freelance, up to 30hrs a week, some weekends. Urgently hiring!


### Socket Paint - Chemist (Remote)

https://gusher.co/startups/socketpaint/roles/chemist

Based in LA but accepting applicants from anywhere. Small team, startup. Looking for someone to '[f]ormulate initial product, prototype, proof of concept', which is an atmosphere you're experienced with. Product is a carbon-negative luminescent paint, aiming to replace traditional lightbulbs without the need for electricity. It's a startup, so there's an 80% chance the company goes under, but they do offer 5% equity in the company, so there's a 20% chance you become financially independent forever.....in theory.

### Ice River Green Bottle Co. - Quality Assurance Technician

https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?q=chemical&l=Calgary%2C%20AB&start=20&vjk=7c3644f90f147336

Company bottles spring water, focus on sustainability and recycling PET plastic (which you have some experience with, it's one of the materials we print with). $18/hr to start but guaranteed increase after 3 months with potential for more. Lots of sampling/analysis/documentation. Extended healthcare benefits, non-standard hours (will rotate weekly).
