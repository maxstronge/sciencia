# 1.4 - Other Mechanical Oscillation Systems:
***

Whenever there is a **restorative force** to act on a mass, oscillations are likely to occur. As we have seen, there must be two agents for mechanical oscillations to occur: one capable of storing kinetic energy (*i.e.* to move), and one capable of storing potential energy (*i.e.* keeping the system moving), like the mass-spring system.

In rotational devices (like the wheel balance in watches), the  **restoring torque** and **rotational intertia** replace the restorative force and mass, respectively, but the energy considerations are the same.

A clock with a pendulum derives its accuracy from the *regularity of its periodic oscillation frequency*.
