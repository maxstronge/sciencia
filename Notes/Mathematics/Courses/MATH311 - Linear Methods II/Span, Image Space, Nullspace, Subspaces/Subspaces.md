# Subspaces and Spanning:
***


We have already introduced the set $\RR^n$ as the set of all *n*-tuples of real numbers (*i.e*. vectors), and  began our investigation of the matrix transformation $\RR^n \to \RR^m$ given by matrix multiplication by an $m\times n$ matrix. Particular attention was paid to the Euclidean plane $\RRii$ where certain simple geometric transformations (translations, rotations, reflections) were seen to be the results of matrix transformations. 

In this chapter we investigate $\RR^n$ in full generality, and introduce some of the most important concepts and methods in linear algebra.

### Subspaces of $\RR^n$:

> #### Definition of a Subspace of $\RR^n$:
> A set *U* of vectors in $\RR^n$ is called a **subspace** of $\RR^n$  if it satisfies the following properties:
> 1. The zero vector $\bf{0} \in U$.
> 2.
