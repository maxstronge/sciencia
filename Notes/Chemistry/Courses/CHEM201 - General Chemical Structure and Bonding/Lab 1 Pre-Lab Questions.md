1. What is the overall balanced equation obtained when *1* and *2* are combined?


**Eq. 1**: 	$\ce{NaHCO3 _\aq + HCl _\aq \longrightarrow H2CO3 _\aq + NaCl _\aq}$

**Eq. 2**: $\ce{H2CO3 _\aq \longrightarrow H2O _\liq + CO2 _\gas }$

To combine the equations, we place all the reactants on the left, all the products on the right, and cancel out any species that appear on both sides of the arrow - in this case, $\ce{H2CO3 _\aq}$. The resulting chemical equation is:


>$$\ce{NaHCO3 _\aq + HCl _\aq \longrightarrow NaCl _\aq + H2O _\liq + CO2 _\gas_}$$

The equation requires no further balancing.

3. **Limiting vs. Excess Reactants:**


> **C**: The $\ce{HCl _\aq}$ was the excess reactant in the described experiment. 
>
> **E**: The pH of the resulting solution was $2$. 
>
> **R**: The low pH of the resulting solution implies that after the reaction, the resulting solution was acidic. Therefore, the $\ce{HCl}$, a strong acid, must have been the excess reactant. If the other species was in excess, the pH of the resulting solution would be higher.

4. **Stoichiometry**:

We can determine the mass of $\ce{NaHCO3}$ required to produce $\pu(0.05 g)$ of $\ce{CO2}$ by utilizing the relationship between moles of a species and mass. This amounts to performing unit cancellation on the balanced chemical equation, using the molar mass to convert moles of a species to the mass in grams. Following this process, we can see how many moles of $\ce{CO2}$ would have a mass of $\pu{0.05 g}$, and then doing the unit conversion on the rest of the species will result in the amount of $\ce{NaHCO3}$ in grams needed to produce the required amount of $\ce{CO2}$.

5. **ASA + Citric Acid:**

The presence of acetylsalicylic and citric acids in the tablet may have an effect on the neutralization reaction between the sodium bicarbonate and the hydrochloric acid. The sodium bicarbonate has more acids to potentially neutralize compared to a solution exclusively containing $\ce{HCl}$ and $\ce{NaHCO3}$ - however, this is unlikely, as the hydrochloric acid is a much stronger acid than either citric or acetylsalicylic acid, and thus is more inclined to lose a proton than the other two compounds mentioned.
