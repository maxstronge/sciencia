# Mechanics in Noninertial Reference Frames:
***

Newton's laws of motion are valid only in a special class of **inertial frames** - reference frames that are neither *accelerating* or *rotating*. Thus far, we have treated all mechanics problems in inertial frames, which in many cases is an appropriate simplification. However, it is often desirable to consider **noninertial** frames. The rotation of the Earth, for example, is often approximated as an inertial frame for small events, but in some cases, it becomes necessary to consider the rotation and the orbit of the planet in order to accurately predict its motion. This is especially true in the physics of rockets/spacecraft. In this chapter, we begin to examine reference frames that are accelerating, rotating, or both.
