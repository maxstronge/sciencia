- Entanglement:
	- unique quantum physical property - allows 2+ particles to act in a correlated way despite separation 
	- Bell's theorem $\implies$ cannot be explained in classical terms

- Entanglement in the Brain:
	- quantum information processing? can have huge advantages - perhaps nature found a way to harness the quantum advantage in computing/communication complexity - uses less bandwidth
	- the Binding Problem of consciousness:
		- how does unified yet complex conscious experience arise from dynamics of many neurons (molecules)? For entangled systems, the whole is more than the sum of its prats in a well-defined physical/mathematical sense
	- What ingredients might nature use to implement quantum functionalities in the brain?
		- current quantum technology can give hints:
			- **photons**: ideal for sending quantum information over macroscopic distances
			- **spins**: can serve as quantum processors/memories(?) even in condensed matter systems at room temperature
		- Photons in the brain: **reactive oxygen species** in mitochondria are one likely source - could these be used for quantum communication?
		- potential single-photon detectors exist in the brain - **opsins** - similar to the ones we have in our retinas
	- Could axons serve as waveguides?
		- refraction properties of axons vs. myelin sheath allow for light guidance - optical fibers?
		- could it be a good photonic waveguide despite imperfections? Dr. Simon & co.'s modelling says yes!
		- **direct tests of light guidance for axons still very welcome**
	
	- radical pair mechanism
	- cryptochrome seems important
		- known to be implicatedi n the brain's response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (RMS)
		- radical pairs are formed in these proteins
	- learn about tryptophan
