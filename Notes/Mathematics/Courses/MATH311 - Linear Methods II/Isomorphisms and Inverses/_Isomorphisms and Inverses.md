# Isomorphisms and Inverses of Linear Transfomrmations:

Often two vector spaces can consist of very different types of vectors, but, on closer examination, turn out to be the *same underlying space* denoted with different symbols. For example, consider the spaces:

### $$\Rii = \qty{(a,b):a,b\in\RR} \qq{and} \Pp_1 = \qty{a+bx:a,b\in\RR}$$

Compare the addition and multiplication in these spaces:

#### $$\begin{align}(a,b)+(a_1,b_1) &= (a+a_1,b+b_1) \\ (a+bx) + (a_1 + b_1x )&= (a+a_1) + (b+b_1)x\end{align}$$

#### $$\begin{align}r(a, b) &= (ra, rb) \\ r(a+bx) &= (ra) + (rb)x \end{align}$$

Clearly these are the same vector spaces in different notation: if we change each $(a,b) \in \Rii$ to $a + bx$, then $\Rii$ *becomes* $\Pp_1$, complete with addition and scalar multiplication. We will investigate this phenomenon further in this chapter.
