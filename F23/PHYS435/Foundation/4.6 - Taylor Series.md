**Taylor's Theorem** provides a way of expressing a function as a [[4.5 - Power Series|power series]] in $x$, known as a **Taylor Series** - but it can only be applied to functions that are *differentiable and continuous* around the neighborhood of $x$ under consideration.

## 4.6.1 - Taylor's Theorem

Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ that we wish to express as a power series in terms of $(x-a)$ about the point $x=a$. 

We shall assume that (in a given $x$-range) $f(x)$ is a continuous, single-valued function of $x$ having continuous derivatives w.r.t $x$, denoted $f'(x), f''(x)$, etc, up to and including $f^{n-1}(x)$.

Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we can write:

$$
\int _{a}^{a+h}f'(x) \, dx =f(a+h)-f(a)
$$

...where $a, a+h$ are neighboring values of $x$. Rearranging this equation, we may express the value of the function at $x=a+h$ in terms of its value at $a$ by

$$
f(a+h)=f(a)+\int _{a}^{a+h}f'(x) \, dx
$$

A first approximation for $f(a+h)$ can be found by substituting $f'(a)$ for $f'(x)$ in [[4.6 - Taylor Series#^17f9e8|the above]] to obtain

$$
f(a+h) \approx f(a)+hf'(a)
$$
 
This approximation is shown graphically below:
