# 12.7 - Alpha Decay:
***

In **alpha decay**, an unstable nucleus **disintegrates** into a lighter nucleus and an **alpha particle** (a nucleus of $^4He$) according to the process:

> ## $$^A_ZX_N \to ^{A-4}_{Z-2}X'_{N-2} + ^4_2He_2 $$

...where *X* and *X'* represent different nuclei. For example, $^{226}_{88}Ra_{138} \to ^{222}_{86}Rn_{136}+^4_2He_2.$

Decay processes release energy, because the decay products are *more tightly bound* than the initial nucleus. The energy released, which appears as the *kinetic energy of the alpha particle* and the **"daughter" nucleus** *X'*, can be found from the masses of the nuclei involved according to [[12.6 - Radioactive Decay#^a5df4d|conservation of energy]]:

> ## $$Q = [m(X)-m(X')-m(^4He)]\;c^2. $$

^20ff4d

Similarly to the calculations of [[12.3 - Nuclear Masses, Binding Energies, and Separation Energies|binding energy]], the electron masses will cancel in this equation, and so we can use *atomic masses* once again.  

The energy *Q* appears as the kinetic energy of the decay products:

> ## $$Q = K_{X'}+K_\alpha $$

...assuming we choose a reference frame in which the initial atom *X* is at rest. As mentioned, [[12.6 - Radioactive Decay#^f18838|linear momentum is also conserved]], so that:

> ## $$p_\alpha = p_{X'}. $$


From these equations, we eliminate $p_{X'}$ and $K_{X'}$, because we typically can't observe the daughter nuclei in the laboratory. 

Typical alpha decay energies are a few $MeV$, and so the kinetic energies of the alpha particle and the nucelus are so much smaller than their rest energies that we can use *nonrelativistic mechanics* to find the kinetic energy of the alpha particle:

> ## $$K_\alpha \cong \frac{A-4}{A}Q. $$

## Example: Finding Kinetic Energies of Emitted Alpha Particles

Find the kinetic energy of the alpha particle emitted in the alpha decay process $^{226}Ra \to ^{222}Ra + ^4He$.

...

Using [[[12.7 - Alpha Decay#^20ff4d]|this equation]] to find Q:

 >  $$\begin{align}
 Q & = [m(^{226}Ra) - m(^{222}Ra)-m(^4He)]c^2 \\
 & = (226.025409u-222.017565u-4.002603u)\left(931.5\frac{MeV}{u}\right)\\
 & = 4.872MeV.
 \end{align}$$
 
 Now that we know *Q*, we can use [[12.7 - Alpha Decay#^b63487|this relation to find K:]]
 
 > $$\begin{align}
 K_\alpha & = \frac{A-4}{A}Q = (\frac{222}{226})(4.872MeV)\\
 & =4.786MeV.
 \end{align}$$

 ## The Quantum Theory of Alpha Decay:
 
 Alpha decay is an example of **quantum-mechanical barrier penetration**. Suppose it is energetically possible for two neutrons and two neutrons to form an alpha particle. The alpha particle is 'trapped' inside the nucleus by a barrier due to the Coulomb potential energy. The height of this barrier, $U_B$, is the Coulomb potential energy of the alpha particle and the daughter nucleus at radius *R*:
 
 > ## $$U_B = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r} = \frac{2(Z-2)e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0R}. $$

This gives ~$30 - 40 \;MeV$ for a typical heavy nucleus. Here $q_1 = 2e$ is the charge of the alpha particle (containing the charge of two protons) and $q_2 = (Z-2)e$ is the electric charge of the daughter nucelus after decay, which is responsible for the Coulomb force. The potential energy barrier and a representation of the alpha particle's wave function are depicted graphically below.

The alpha particle typically has an energy in the range ~$5 - 8\; MeV$, and so it is impossible classically for it to surmount the potential energy barrier - it would end up with negative kinetic energy if observed. The only way the alpha particle can escape is for it to **tunnel** through the barrier.

The probability per unit time $\lambda$ for the alpha particle to appear in the laboratory is the probability of *it penetrating the barrier* multiplied by *the number of times per second the alpha particle strikes the barrier in attempt to escape*. If an alpha particle is moving at speed *v* inside a nucleus of radius *R*, it will strike the barrier as it bounces back and forth inside the nucleus at time intervals of $2R/v$. In a heavy nucleus with *R* ~$6\;fm$, the $\alpha$ particle strikes the 'wall' of the nucleus about $10^{22}$ times per second!

The probability for the alpha particle to penetrate the barrier can be found by solving the Schrödinger equation for the potential energy of the nucleus. To simplify this calculation, we can replace the Coulomb barrier with a simplified 'flat' barrier, as shown:

![[Pasted image 20210420120146.png]]

As discussed [[5.4 - Applications of the Schrödinger Equation|earlier]], the probability to penetrate a potential energy barrier is determined by the **exponential factor** $e^{-2kL}$, where *L* is the thickness of the barrier and $k = \sqrt{(2m/\hbar^2)(U_0 - E)}$ for a barrier of height $U_0$ and a particle of energy $E$.

The decay probability can then be estimated as:

> ## $$\lambda = \frac{v}{2R}e^{-2kL} $$

...which includes both the *rate* at which the particle strikes the barrier and its *probability to penetrate it*.
