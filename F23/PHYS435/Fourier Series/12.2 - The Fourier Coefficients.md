We now consider how to find the Fourier coefficients for any particular function (that satisfies the [[12.1 - The Dirichlet Conditions and the Fourier Series|Dirichlet Conditions]]).

For a periodic function $f(x)$ of period $L$, we find that the Fourier coefficients are given by:

$$
\begin{align}
a_{r} &= \frac{2}{L}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \, dx  \\

b_{r} &= \frac{2}{L} \int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x)\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \, dx 

\end{align}
$$

where $x_{0}$ is arbitrary, but is often taken as $0$ (to $L$) or $-\frac{L}{2}$ (to $\frac{L}{2}$).

In the [[12.1 - The Dirichlet Conditions and the Fourier Series#^30c7a3|formula for a Fourier series]], there is a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ in the $a_0$ term - this is introduced to ensure that [[#^6cec50| the first of these expressions]] is valid for the case that $r=0$ as well as for $r>0$. That $a_{0}$ term serves as a constant scaling factor of sorts. 

We can derive the formulae for the Fourier coefficients in the following way:

Recall the definition of the Fourier series expansion for $f(x)$:

$$
f(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( a_{r}\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)+b_{r}\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \right)
$$

If we multiply by a factor of $\cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)$ and integrate with respect to $x$ over one full period:

$$
\begin{align}

\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right) \, dx 
&= \frac{a_{0}}{2}\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}\cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)\, dx  \\&+ \sum_{r=1}^\infty a_{r}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} \cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)\, dx \\&+\sum_{r=1}^\infty b_{r}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} \cos\left( \frac{2\pi px}{L} \right)\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)\, dx 
\end{align}
$$

*(We have also changed the order of summation and integration above.)*

We are crucially assuming that $p\neq r$ to take advantage of the fact that successive terms in a Fourier series are **mutually orthogonal**. When $p=0$, the above equation reduces to 

$$
\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x) \, dx  = \frac{a_{0}}{2}L
$$
When $p\neq 0$, the only non-vanishing term on the RHS of the long equation above occurs when $r=p$, and so:

$$
\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)dx = \frac{a_{r}}{2}L
$$
$$

$$
and thus 

$$
a_{r} = \frac{2}{L}\int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L} f(x)\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \, dx
$$

Similar logic can be applied to find the coefficients $b_{r}$ by multiplying by $\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)$ instead.

**Example:** Express the square-wave function $f(t)$ shown below as a Fourier series.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

The function can be described as a piecewise function 
$$
f(t) = \begin{cases}

-1 & \text{if} & -\frac{T}{2}\leq t<0 \\
1 & \text{if} & 0 \leq t < \frac{T}{2}
\end{cases}
$$
We can first note that $f(t)$ is an *odd* function (satisfies $f(x) = -f(-x)$), so all of the cosine terms will be zero, and we need only sine terms. We use the earlier relation to find the coefficients $b_{r}$:
$$
b_{r} = \frac{2}{L} \int _{x_{0}}^{x_{0}+L}f(x)\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \, dx 
$$
The period is $T$. Note that the function $f(x)$ is an odd function, as is $\sin$, so the product of these functions is an *even* function. For even functions of this type, we are allowed to change the bounds of integration from $(-\frac{T}{2},\frac{T}{2})$  to $\left( 0, \frac{T}{2} \right)$ at the expense of picking up a factor of 2:


$$
b_{r}=\frac{4}{T} \int_{0}^{T/2} f(t)\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rt}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

We have restricted the domain such that $f(t)$ is always equal to 1 everywhere over the integration, so $f(t)$ will drop out of the integral here, leaving us with:


$$
b_{r}=\frac{4}{T} \int_{0}^{T/2} \sin\left( \frac{2\pi rt}{T} \right) \, dt = \frac{2}{\pi r} \left( 1-(-1)^r \right) 
$$





So the 


Consider $f(x) = |\sin(x)|^{-1/2}, \\ -\infty \leq x < \infty$

This is a periodic function of period $\pi$ and, although it becomes infinite at $x=n\pi$, there are no infinite *discontinuities*. Near the point $x=0$, it behaves the same as $|x|^{-1/2}$ ...

Recall the definition of the Fourier series:

$$
f(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{r=1}^\infty \left( a_{r}\cos\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right)+b_{r}\sin\left( \frac{2\pi rx}{L} \right) \right)
$$

The terms involving $a_{0}$ and $a_{r}$ are *even*, terms involving $b_{r}$ are odd. Here, $r$ is an integer and $L$ is the period. To express a function in terms of a Fourier series, what we need to do is find the coefficients.

The term $\frac{a_{0}}{2}$ is called the **DC Level**, which is a constant that serves as a scaling term.
=======
The square-wave function can be written as a piecewise-defined function:

$$

f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
-1 & \text{for } & -\frac{1}{2}T \leq t < 0,\\ 
1  & \text{for } & 0 \leq t < \frac{1}{2}T
\end{cases}
$$
