# Orthogonality:

***

We are familiar with the standard *dot product* in $\Rn$, and we have extended the geometric notions of length/distance to more general environments. [[Orthogonality and Orthonormality#^47831f|Recall]] that a set $\qty{\vb{f}_1, \vb{f}_2, \dots, \vb{f}_n}$ of nonzero vectors in $\Rn$ is called an **orthogonal set** if $\vb{f}_i \cdot \vb{f}_j$ for all $i \neq j$, and it was proved that *every* orthogonal set is *linearly independent*. 

In particular, it was observed that the expansion of a vector as a linear combination of orthogonal basis vectors is easy to obtain because formulas exist for the coefficients. Hence the orthogonal bases are the "nice" bases - much of this chapter is dedicated to extending and generalizing results about bases to orthogonal bases. This leads to some very powerful methods and theorems. Our first task will be to prove that every subspace of $\Rn$ does indeed have an orthogonal basis.
