## Professor:
Dr. Timothy Friesen

Dr. Friesen's research is in precise measurements of the properties of antimatter vs matter (are energy level differences identical?)


## Course Outcomes:

- Develop experimental physics skills
	- experimental setups, data collection, analysis
	- experimental design
	- AC+DC circuits, vacuum technology
- Effective scientific communication
	- Lab reports
	- Detector project
- Effective group work
- Operate a voltmeter, ammeter, and oscilloscope to measure current, voltage, resistance and phase in simple  
- AC/DC circuits  
- Explain how measurement devices function including voltmeters, ammeters, and oscilloscopes  
- Characterize and construct simple passive DC and AC circuits including voltage dividers, high, low, bandpass, and notch filters  
- Explain the operation of laboratory instrumentation used in physics research
- Collaborate in a group to execute laboratory experiments.
- Demonstrate proper laboratory techniques including data acquisition, analysis of data and uncertainty, and safe operation of equipment
- Clearly and accurately communicate concepts and arguments in writing
