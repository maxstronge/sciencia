**1. Elastic Filament**

For an elastic filament it is found that, at a finite range in temperature,  displacement $x$ requires a force

$$J=ax-bT+cTx$$

...where $a$,$b$, and $c$ are constants. Furthermore, its heat capacity at constant displacement $x$ is proportional to temperature - that is, $C_x=A(x)T$.

- a) Calculate $\left( \pdv{S}{x}\right)_T.$
- b) Expressing $C_x$ in terms of partial derivatives of the entropy show that $A$ must be independent of $x$. 
- c) Give the expression for $S(T,x)$ assuming $S(0,0)=S_0.$
- d) Calculate the heat capacity at constant tension, that is, $C_J=T\left( \pdv{S}{T}\right)_J$ as a function of $T$ and $J$.

**Solution:**

a) We have a generalized force $J=J(T,x)$ representing the tension, and a generalized coordinate $x$ representing the displacement. Starting from the modified 1st law:

$$dU=TdS+Jdx$$

We can

**2. Heat Capacities:**

For a generalized reversible thermodynamic process involving a generalized force $J$, a generalized coordinate $q$, and a temperature $T$, express the heat capacities $C_q$ and $C_J$ in terms of partial derivatives of the entropy.

**3. Towards a real gas:**


A gas obeys the equation of state $p(V-Nb)=Nk_B T$ with $b>0$, and has a heat capacity $C_V$ independent of temperature $T$ ($N$ fixed).

- a) Find the Maxwell relation involving $\pdv{S}{V}_{T,N}$.
- b) By calculating $dU(T,V)$, show that $U$ is a function of $T$ (and $N$) only. 
- c) Show that $\gg = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = 1+\frac{Nk_B}{C_V}$ (independent of $T$ and $V$).
- d) By writing an expression for $U(p,V)$, or otherwise, show that an adiabatic change satisfies the equation $p(V-Nb)^\gg=$ constant.

**Solution:**
