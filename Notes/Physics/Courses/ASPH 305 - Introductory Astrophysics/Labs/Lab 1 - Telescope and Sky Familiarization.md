## Part I: Recognizing Stars, Constellations, and Other Features

#### 1: *North Sky, Date 1*

#### 2: *South Sky, Date 1*

#### 3: *North Sky, Date 2*

#### 4: *South Sky, Date 2*

#### 5: Reasoning
We can determine which dates are winter and which are summer by the presence of certain constellations that only appear in one season or the other. For example:

- Gemini, Orion, Canis Major, Taurus and Perseus are visible during winter in the Northern Hemisphere - we can see these constellations in the* South Sky Date 2* video, so Date 2 must be in winter.
-  We can confirm this by examining the view of the Northern sky that was briefly present in the *South Sky Date 2* video - the relative positions of Ursa Major, Polaris, and Cepheus match those drawn on the *North Sky Date 2* video. In the *North Sky Date 1* drawing, the arrangement of Ursa Major, Polaris, and Cepheus are reversed. 
-  We can also note that Sagittarius, a constellation typically only visible in summer, appears in the *South Sky Date 1* drawing. 

With those observations, we can deduce that Date 1 is in summer, and Date 2 is in winter. In the videos, this was confirmed: the Date 1 videos were said to have been recorded in July, and the Date 2 videos in January.

## Part II: Finding Your Latitude on Earth

1: Circumpolar stars identified from video as anything with 40$\degree$declination or higher

 2: Horizontal coordinate system proof -> altitude $\theta$ of the north celestial pole = latitude $\alpha$ of observer

3: Stars will be circumpolar if the sum of their declination $\delta$ and the latitude of the observer $\theta$ is greater than 90$\degree$:


$$\delta + \theta \geq 90\degree$$

Since we know from part 1 that any star with declination 40$\degree$ or greater will be circumpolar, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the latitude of the observer:

$$\theta = 50 \degree. $$

It's possible the observer was located slightly South of Calgary, which is ~51$\degree$ latitude.
