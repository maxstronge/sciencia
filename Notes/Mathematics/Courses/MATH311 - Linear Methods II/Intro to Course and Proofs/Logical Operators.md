# Logical Operators:

 A **statement** is a sentence that can be classified as either **true** or **false**.
 
 An **implication** is a conditional statement of the form "if *p*, then *q*...". In mathematical notation, this is written as $p \implies 	q$, where *q* is **implied** by *p*. 
 
 For example, the statement "a square matrix $\bf{A}$ is invertible" implies that the determinant of $\bf{A}$ is not equal to zero. 

 
$$\mathit{x}\text{ is even } \implies \frac{x}{2} \in \bf{I}.$$


$$\bf{A}\text{ is invertible } \implies \det(\bf{A})\neq 0.$$
