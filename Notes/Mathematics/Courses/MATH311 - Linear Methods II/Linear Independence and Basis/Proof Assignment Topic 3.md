Let $U$ be a subspace of $\RR^n$ with dimension $m$. 

Recall that the dimension of $U$, $\text{dim}(U)$, is the number of linearly independent vectors in the *basis* of $U$. 

**Claim**: a set $S$ is linearly independent $\iff$ $S$ spans $U$. 

To prove, we need to demonstrate that both statements imply one another, proving both of the following:

- A set $S$ is **linearly independent** $\implies$ $S$ spans $U$, *and*....
- A set $S$ spans $U$ $\implies S$ is linearly independent. 

By definition: a set $S$ of vectors $\{\vec{x_1}, \vec{x_2}, \dots, \vec{x_n} \}$ is linearly independent $\iff$ the equation $t_1 \vec{x_1} + t_2\vec{x_2} + \dots + t_k \vec{x_k} = 0$ has only the trivial solution $t_1=t_2=\dots=t_n = 0.$


The fact that  $U$ is a subspace of $\RR^n \implies$$U$ is a set of vectors in $\RR^n$. Because $U$ has dimension *m*, the number of vectors in the *basis* of $U$ is *m*. Let the basis of $U$, then,  be the set of basis vectors $\{\vec{b_1},\dots, \vec{b_m}\}$.
