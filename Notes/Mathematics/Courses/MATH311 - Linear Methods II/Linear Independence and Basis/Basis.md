**Definition**: Let $U$ be a subspace of $\RR^n$. A set $S = \{\vec{x_1}, \vec{x_2}, \dots, \vec{x_m} \}$ is called a **basis** of $U$ if the following two conditions are satisfied:

1. $U = \text{span}\{\vec{x_1}, \vec{x_2}, \dots, \vec{x_m} \}$, and...
2. $\{\vec{x_1}, \vec{x_2}, \dots, \vec{x_m} \}$ is linearly independent. 

In other words, the basis of $U$ is the **minimal spanning set** of $U$.

Every possible subspace $U \subseteq \RR^n$ has an *infinite number* of possible bases. 


**Theorem**: Let $\{\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2},\dots, \vec{v_n}\}$ be a basis for $V$. If a subset of $V$ contains:

- *a)* more than $n$ vectors, then it is linearly dependent.
- *b)* less than $n$ vectors, then it does not span $V$.


**Proof**: ....

## The Invariance Theorem:
> All bases of a subspace $U \subseteq \RR^n$ have the **same number of vectors**.
