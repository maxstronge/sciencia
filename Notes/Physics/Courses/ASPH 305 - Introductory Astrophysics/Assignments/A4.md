One common task performed by astronomers is to identify the atoms and molecules that produce observed spectral lines, as well as the quantum states from which they arise. The figure on the right is a radio wavelength spectrum of a rotational transition (*i.e.* $n_{\text{upper}}$ to $n_{\text{lower}}$). You may assume that the only allowed transitions are between adjacent energy levels (*i.e.* $\DD n = \pm 1$ for hydrogen, and $\DD J = \pm 1$ for the molecule). Based on *i)* the Bohr model for the hydrogen atom and *ii)* the table and figure below (which provide a spectrum and the rotation constants for 6 different molecules), determine:

- a)  which hydrogen transition (*i.e.* $n_{\text{upper}}$ to $n_{\text{lower}}$) produces the observed spectral line, and which of these lines belongs to hydrogen and which to the molecule. Do not use any H transitions with $n_{\text{upper}} \gt 200$. 
- b) which rotational transition (*i.e.* $J_{\text{upper}}$ to $J_{\text{lower}}$) of which molecule produces the observed spectral line. Do not use any molecular transitions with $J_{\text{upper}} \gt 6$.

**NB**: Use high precision constants:

- $R = 13.6056981 \ eV$
- $h = 6.62607004 \times 10^{-34} \ J \, s$
- $1 \ eV = 1.602176565\times10^{-19} \ J.$

**Solution**:

  **a)**
  
The energy emited in a transition between two adjacent energy levels, $n$ and $n-1$, can be given by the following formula:

$$\DD E = E_f - E_i = h \nu = R \qty(\frac{1}{(n-1)^2}-\frac{1}{n^2}).$$

We can rearrange the above equation to isolate the frequency $\nu$:

$$\nu = \frac{R}{h} \qty(\frac{1}{(n-1)^2}-\frac{1}{n^2})$$

We need to solve this equation to determine which values of $n$ will result in one of the transitions displayed on the plot. 

The spike on the left corresponds to a frequency of $1.55 \times 10^9 \ Hz$. Inserting that frequency into the above equation and solving numerically for $n$ yields $n\approx 162.418.$ 

Doing the same for the second frequency, $1.62 \times 10^9 \ Hz$ gives $n\approx160.051$. 

Since $n$ must be an integer, we can conclude that the electronic hydrogen transition $n_{160}\to n_{159}$ most likely resulted in the spike on the right of the plot, and the decimal portion of our answer is a result of rounding. 

**b)**

The energy emitted by a molecular rotational transition (for simple diatomic molecules) can be given by 

$$E_\text{rot} = BJ(J+1), $$

where $B$ is the rotational constant for that molecule and $J$ is the rotational quantum number. Again, we can substitute $h\nu$ in for $E$ and rearrange:

$$\nu = \frac{BJ}{h}(J+1).$$

Solving numerically once again, inserting the remaining frequency spike on the specturm, we find

 The spectrum below shows the hydrogen emission lines from two stars in a binary star system when they are at maximum red/blueshift. It takes 27.169 years for the spectra to look exactly like this again. Based on spectral typing, Star 1 is an $O9V$ star and Star 2 is an $M0I$ star. Use this and the data available at [this website](https://sites.uni.edu/morgans/astro/course/Notes/section2/spectraltemps.html) to perform the following calculations. You may assume that $T_\Sun = 5800 \ K$ and the inclination of the system is $90\degree$. 
 
 - a) Calculate the radius of both stars (in $R_\Sun$).
 - b) Calculate the masses of both stars (in $M_\Sun$).
 - c) Calculate the semi-major axis of each star's orbit (in $AU$).
 - d) If Star 1 (the $O9V$ star) is producing energy via the $p$-$p$ chain, calculate how many $kg$ of hydrogen it consumes per second (*i.e.* not the 'missing mass', but the amount of $H$ converted to $He$).
 - e) If we assume that stars begin with $100\%$ hydrogen, and that a star evolves off the main sequence when it consumes $10\%$ of its initial hydrogen mass, calculate the main sequence lifetime of Star 1 (in years). Compare to the sun's main sequence lifetime.
 - f) If stars did not produce energy via the $p$-$p$ chain, but instead simply converted mass to energy with $100\%$ efficiency, how much mass (in $kg$) would Star 1 have to consume per second? What would its MS lifetime be (in years) in this energy generation scenario?

# 3. 

High-resolution observations of the center of our galaxy (distance $= 8.5 \ kpc$) show stars within $\approx 0.1\text{"}$ of the galactic center that are orbiting an invisible object. The $H\aa$ spectrum ($\ll_0 = 656.6 \ nm$) of one of these stars shows a doppler shift of $\DD \ll = 1.6415 \ nm$, and the motion in the plane of the sky (*i.e.* proper motion) of $0.05\text{"}$ between Jan. 1, 1994 and Jan. 1, 1996. 

- a) If the star is $0.13\text{"}$ from the center of mass, calculate the mass of the invisible central object (in $M_\Sun$) assuming that the orbit is circular.
- b) Subsequent long-term observations show that on Jan. 1, 1997, the star is at the aphelion position in its orbit ($0.2169\text{"}$ from the center of mass) and a few years later, on Aug. 9, 2004, the star is at its perihelion distance ($0.0141\text{"}$ from CM). Calculate the eccentricity of the star's orbit and calculate a revised mass for the central object (in $M_\Sun$).
- c) Recent measurements from the Event Horizon telescope yield an angular diameter of this object of $20 \ \mu as$. Calculate the maximum radius of this object (in $AU$) and the minimum escape velocity from the surface of the object (in $km/s$). Based on your calculations, speculate on what the central object could be.

# 4. 
Using both radial velocity and stellar transit data, you determine that a distant star has a planet orbiting around it. The radial velocity and light curves are shown below:
![[Pasted image 20211206122732.png]]
Given the spectral type of this star ($G0V$), and assuming that the inclination of the orbit is $90 \degree$:

- a) Calculate the planet's mass (in units of Earth mass $M_\Earth = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \ kg$) and semi-major axis of its orbit (in $AU$).
- b) Using the orbital velocity information, calculate the radius of the planet (in units of $R_\Earth = 6400 \km$), the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the planet(in $m/s^2$), and the radius of the star (in $R_\Sun$). Compare to the stellar radius you obtain from the luminosity & temperature information. Assume $T_\Sun = 5800 \ K$. 
- c) Calculate the temperature of the planet (in $K$ and $\degree C$). Assume that the planetary surface area that intercepts the stellar radiation is $\pi R^2$, where $R$ is the planetary radius. Then assume that $80\%$ of this energy is absorbed, and that the planet then radiates the same amount of energy back into space as a spherical black body of temperature $T$. Based on this, determine whether the planet is in the "Goldilocks Zone".
