# 9.4 - Time Derivatives in a Rotating Frame: 
***

We are now ready to consider the equations of motion for an object that is viewed from a frame $\mathbb{S}$ that is rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ relative to an inertial frame $\mathbb{S_0}$. 

While our conclusions will apply to any rotating frame, the most important example is a frame fixed to the rotating Earth - let us pause to calculate $\Omega$ for the Earth:

> ## $$\Omega = \frac{2\pi\; \text{radians}}{24 \times 3600s} = 7.3 \times 10^{-5}\text{rad/s}. $$

This angular velocity is so small we often ignore it entirely - however, the Earth's rotation does have measurable effects on the motion of projectiles, pendulums, and other systems. 

We shall observe two frames, $\mathbb{S_0}$ (shown in the figure with dotted axes) and $\mathbb{S}$, sharing an origin *O*, such that the only motion of $\mathbb{S}$ relative to $\mathbb{S_0}$ is a rotation with angular velocity $\Omega$:

 Let us now consider an arbitrary vector $\vec{Q}$, which could be a velocity, a position, etc. Our first task to to relate the *rate of change* of $\vec{Q}$ in $\mathbb{S_0}$ to the corresponding rate as measured in $\mathbb{S}$. To distinguish the two, we will temporarily use the notation:
 
 > $$\LARGE
 \begin{align}
 \left(\frac{d\vec{Q}}{dt}\right)_{S_0} & = \text{rate of change as measured from}\,\mathbb{S_0}\\
 \left(\frac{d\vec{Q}}{dt}\right)_S & = \text{rate of change as measured from}\,\mathbb{S}.\\
 \end{align}$$
 
 To compare these two rates of change, we shall expand the vector $\vec{Q}$ in terms of 3 orthogonal unit vectors $e_1,e_2$, and $e_3$ that are fixed in the rotating frame $\mathbb{S}$. Thus:
 
 > ## $$\vec{Q} = Q_1e_1 + Q_2e_2 + Q_3e_3 = \sum_{i=1}^3 Q_ie_i. $$

This expansion is chosen for the convenience of observers in the frame $\mathbb{S}$, but it is equally valid in $\mathbb{S_0}$. The only difference is that in the rotating frame, the three unit vectors are fixed, while in the inertial frame, they are rotating. 

Let us now differentiate this expansion with respect to time. First, as seen in frame $\mathbb{S}$, the vectors $e_i$ are constant, and we get simply:

> ## $$\left(\frac{d\vec{Q}}{dt}\right)_{S} = \sum_i \frac{dQ_i}{dt}e_i.  $$

As seen in frame $\mathbb{S_0}$, the vectors $e_i$ vary with time. Thus differentiating in this frame gives:

> ## $$\left(\frac{d\vec{Q}}{dt}\right)_{S_0} = \sum_i \frac{dQ_i}{dt}e_i+\sum_i Q_i \left( \frac{de_i}{dt}\right)_{S_0}.$$

The derivative in the second term on the right is easily evaluated with the help of the [[9.2 - Relation between Linear and Angular Velocity|useful relation]] from earlier: the vector $e_i$ is fixed in the frame $\mathbb{S}$, which is rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ relative to $\mathbb{S_0}$. Therefore the rate of change of $e_i$ as seen in $\mathbb{S_0}$ is given as:

> ## $$\left( \frac{de_i}{dt}\right)_{S_0} = \Omega \times e_i. $$

We can therefore rewrite the second sum as:

> ### $$\sum_i Q_i \left( \frac{de_i}{dt}\right)_{S_0} = \sum_i Q_i (\Omega \times e_i) = \Omega \times \sum_iQ_ie_i = \Omega \times \vec{Q}. $$

If we insert this result into our relation between the time derivatives in the two frames, we find that:

> ## $$\left(\frac{d\vec{Q}}{dt}\right)_{S_0} = \left(\frac{d\vec{Q}}{dt}\right)_{S}+\Omega \times \vec{Q}. $$

This important identity relates the derivative of any vector $\vec{Q}$ as measured in the inertial frame $\mathbb{S_0}$ to the corresponding derivative in the rotating frame $\mathbb{S}$. We shall use it in the next section to find the form of Newton's second law in a rotating frame.
