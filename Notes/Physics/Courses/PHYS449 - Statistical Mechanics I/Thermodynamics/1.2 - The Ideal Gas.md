# 1.2 - The Ideal Gas:

**LO**: Explain concepts of work and heat to precisely formulate the 1st law of thermodynamics. 

Mathematical background: exact/inexact differentials, partial derivatives, path integrals, integrating factors.

### The Ideal Gas Law

Many of the properties of a low-density gas can be summarized in the famous **ideal gas law**:


> $$PV=nRT = Nk_BT$$

In this equation, $T$ **must** be the temperature in kelvins. Celsius values will yield nonsense. The value of $R$ is a universal constant:

$$R=8.31 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{K}}$$

...in SI units. 

A **mole** of molecules is *Avogadro's number* of them:

$$N_A=6.02\times10^{23}$$

But this is more helpful for chemists - physicists are more concerned with the number of molecules, given by 

$$N=n\times N_A$$

so we can create a new constant $k_B=\frac{R}{N_A}$

and we have 

$$pV=Nk_BT$$

...which is the main form we will use. To remember how to switch:

$$nR=Nk_B$$

## Microscopic model of the ideal gas:

We have not yet connected energy to the idea of temperature.  This is simple to do for an ideal gas:

but i'm not gonna do it
