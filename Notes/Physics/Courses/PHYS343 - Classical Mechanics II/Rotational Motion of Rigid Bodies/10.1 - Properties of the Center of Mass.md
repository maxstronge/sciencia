# 10.1: Properties of the Center of Mass
***

Consider a system of *N* particles, $\alpha = 1,...,N$, with masses $m_\alpha$ and positions $r_\alpha$ measured relative to a chosen origin, *O*.

The *position of the center of mass* is defined as:

>## $$R = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N} m_\alpha r_\alpha $$

or, as an integral,

>### $$\frac{1}{M} \int_{object} r \,dm$$

...where *M* denotes the total mass of all *N* particles, and the integral form is used when the system can be considered to be a *continuous distribution of mass*.

## The Total Momentum and the Center of Mass:

Several important parameters of the system's motion can be neatly expressed in terms of the **CM**. The total momentum is:

>### $$\boldsymbol{P} = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha = \sum_\alpha m_\alpha \dot r_\alpha = M \dot R$$

That is, the total momentum of the system is exactly the same as that of a single particle of mass *M* moving with velocity equal to that of the *CM*. If we differentiate this result, we see that $\dot{\boldsymbol{P}} = M \ddot{R}$, or, since $\dot{\boldsymbol{P}}$ equals the net external force $F^{ext}$ on the system by Newton's 2nd Law:

>### $$ F^{ext} = M \ddot R.$$

That is, the *CM* moves just as if it were a single particle of mass *M* subject to the net external force on the system. 

This result is the single most important justification for our treating extended objects as point masses. To the extent that extended objects like comets and baseballs can be represented by their *CM*, they really do behave just like particles!

## The Total Angular Momentum:


The role of the *CM* motion in a system's total angular momentum is more complicated, but equally crucial. The following argument does not depend on the the system in question being a rigid body, but to be definite, let us consider a rigid body made up of *N* particles with mass $m_\alpha$ as before.

![[Pasted image 20210414135951.png]]

The position of $m_\alpha$ realtive to some arbitrary origin *O* is shown in the figure as $r_\alpha$, and the position of the *CM* relative to *O* as *R*. Also shown is the position $r_\alpha '$ of $m_\alpha$ relative to the *CM*, which satisfies:

>### $$ r_\alpha = R + r_\alpha '.$$

The angular momentum $\ell_\alpha$ of a mass element $m\alpha$ about the origin *O* is:


>### $$ \ell_\alpha = r \times p_\alpha = r_\alpha \times m_\alpha \dot {r_\alpha}. $$


Thus the total angular momentum realtive to *O* is:


>### $$ \boldsymbol{L} = \sum_\alpha \ell_\alpha = \sum_\alpha r_\alpha \times m_\alpha \dot{r_\alpha}. $$


If we use [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass#r_ alpha R r_ alpha '|this definition]] to rewrite both $r_\alpha$ and $\dot r_\alpha$, we find that $\boldsymbol L$ is the sum of 4 terms:


>### $$ \boldsymbol L = \sum R \times m_\alpha \dot R + \sum R \times m_\alpha \dot r_\alpha' + \sum r_alpha \times m_\alpha \dot R + \sum r'_\alpha \times m_\alpha \dot r'_\alpha. $$

We can factor the terms that do not depend on $\alpha$ out of each of these 4 sums, and (remembering that $\sum m_\alpha = M$):

>### $$ \boldsymbol R \times M \dot R + R \times \sum m_\alpha \dot r'_\alpha + (\sum m_\alpha r'_\alpha) \times \dot R + \sum r'_\alpha + m_\alpha \dot r'_\alpha.$$
This expression can now be dramatically simplified: Notice first that the sum in parentheses on the third term on the right is *[[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass#R frac 1 M sum_ alpha 1 N m_\alpha r_\alpha|the position of the center of mass relative to the center of mass]]*, multiplied by M. This is, of course, zero:

>### $$ \sum m_\alpha r'_\alpha = 0.$$

...and therefore, that term in [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass#boldsymbol R times M dot R R times sum m_ alpha dot r'_ alpha sum m_ alpha r'_ alpha times dot R sum r'_ alpha m_alpha dot r'_alpha | the previous expression]] becomes zero as well. 

If we differentiate [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass#sum m_ alpha r'_ alpha 0| this relation]], this obviously remains zero:

>### $$ \sum m_\alpha \dot r'_\alpha = 0. $$

We can recognize [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass#sum m_ alpha dot r'_ alpha 0|this]] as the sum in the [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass#boldsymbol R times M dot R R times sum m_ alpha dot r'_ alpha sum m_ alpha r'_ alpha times dot R sum r'_ alpha m_ alpha dot r'_ alpha| second term of the angular momentum]], simplifying our result even further. All that remains is: 

>### $$\boldsymbol L = R \times P = \sum r'_\alpha \times m_\alpha \dot r'_\alpha. $$

The first term is the angular momentum (relative to *O*) of the motion of the *CM*. The second term is the angular momentum of the motion *relative to* the *CM*. We can rephrase this to say:

>## $$\boldsymbol L = \boldsymbol L_{\text{motion of CM}} + \boldsymbol L_{\text{motion relative to CM}}. $$


***
## Kinetic Energy:

The total kinetic energy of *N* particles is:

>### $$ T = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_\alpha \dot r_\alpha^2.$$

As before, we can use  [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass#r_ alpha R r_ alpha '|this relation]] to replace $r_\alpha$ with $R + r'_\alpha$ , which gives:  $\dot r_\alpha ^2 = (\dot R +\dot r'_\alpha)^2 = \dot R^2 + \dot{r'_\alpha}^2 + 2\dot R \cdot \dot r'_\alpha$ , and hence,
 
> ### $$ T = \frac{1}{2}\sum m_\alpha \dot R^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sum m_\alpha \dot {r'_\alpha} ^2 + \dot R \sum m_\alpha \dot r'_\alpha.$$
 
 Once again, the last term is zero, and we find that:
 
 >## $$ T = \frac{1}{2}(M\dot R^2 + \sum m_\alpha \dot {r'_\alpha}^2)$$
 
 or,
 
 >### $$ T = T_{\text{motion of CM}} + T_{\text{motion relative to CM}}. $$
 
 just as with the angular momentum.

 ## Potential Energy:
 
 If all the forces on/within an *N*-particle system are **conservative** (they depend only on the position $r$) then the total potential energy of the system can be written as:
 
 > ## $$U = U^{ext} + U^{int} $$
 > ...where $U^{ext}$ is the sum of all potential energies due to external forces.

The **internal potential energy**, $U^{int}$, is the sum of the potential energies due to every pair of particles:

> ### $$U^{int} = {\underset{\alpha \lt \beta}\sum}  	U_{\alpha \beta}(r(\alpha \beta)) $$
> ...where $r_{\alpha \beta}$ is the distance between particles $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

However, in a rigid body (by definition) all of the interparticle distances $r_{\alpha \beta}$ are fixed: therefore, the internal potential energy *is a constant*, and may be ignored. In discussing the motion of a rigid body,  we consider only the *external* forces and their corresponding potential energies.
