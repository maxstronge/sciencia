# Optical Telescopes:

Telescopes are the primary instrument used to study astronomy.

The telescope fulfills three major tasks in astronomical observations:

1. It collects light from a large area, making it possible to study very faint light sources.
2. It increases the *apparent* angular diameter of the object and improves the resolution (drastically, compared to the human eye)
3. It is used to measure the positions of objects.

The light-collecting surface inside a telescope is either a *lens* or a *mirror* - thus, optical telescopes are divided into two types: lens telescopes, called **refractors**, and mirror telescopes, called **reflectors**.

### Geometric Optics - Refractors:

Refractors have two lenses: the **objective** lens, which collects incoming light and forms an image in the **focal plane**, and the **eyepiece**, a small magnifying glass for looking at the image. 

The lenses are on opposite sides of a tube, which can be directed towards any desired point. The distance between the eyepiece and the focal plane can be adjusted to get the image into focus.

The *diameter* of the objective lens, denoted $D$, is called the **aperture** of the telescope (this also applies to the diameter of the mirror of reflectors). 

The ratio of the aperture $D$ to the focal length $f, \, F=D / f$, is called the **aperture ratio**, a quantity used to characterize the light-gathering power of the telescope. If the aperture ratio is large (~1), the telescope image is very bright, which means photographs can be taken with short exposure. Smaller aperture ratios lead to dimmer images $\implies$ longer exposures necessary.
