- Over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries CE, the nature of European warfare changed dramatically - unsettled argument as to how/why/what the consequences were


## Late Medieval Warfare:

- Medieval armies were (as far as we can tell) raised by obligation/social contract, but supplanted by *contract* (i.e. mercenary) forces from 1400 onwards (in emergencies, could levy the commoners)
- England/France fighting a 100 years war - the idea of 'obligation' got tested (who wants to volunteer to sit on a field and get dysentery for months at a time?)



## Gunpowder & Early Artillery

- Gunpowder (sulfur, saltpetre and charcoal) - first invented in China, but its development limited by the context (Yuan dynasty, Mongol empire) - security context: pastoral nomads from the North (Mongolia) - not super useful for military to bring heavy guns to chase down fast-moving horse archers
- The Mongols almost definitely played a role in the transmission of gunpowder knowledge/technologies across Eurasia into Europe/Near East by the 14th century - these regions are competitive and fractured -> good for military tech dev
