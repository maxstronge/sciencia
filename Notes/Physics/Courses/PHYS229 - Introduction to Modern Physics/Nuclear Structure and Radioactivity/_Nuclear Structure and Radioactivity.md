The nucleus lies at the center of the atom, occupying only $10^{-5}$ *m* of its volume, but providing the positive charge that holds the atom together via the Coulomb force. Within the nucleus, there are *Z* positive charges, where *Z* is the atomic number (1 for hydrogen, 2 for helium, etc.) . To keep these positive charges within the nucleus from flying apart, the *nuclear force* must supply an attraction that overcomes the incredibly strong electrical repulsion that comes from the positive charges being so close together. This nuclear force is the strongest of the 4 known fundamental forces; it provides *nuclear binding energies* that are millions of times stronger than the atomic binding energies. 

There are many similarities between the atomic structure and the nuclear structure, which will make our study of the properties of the nucleus somewhat familiar. Nuclei are subject to the laws of quantum mechanics. They have *ground*  and *excited* states, and *emit photons* in *transitions* between the excited states. Just like atomic states, nuclear states can be labelled by their *angular momentum*. 

There are, however, two major differences between the study of atomic and nuclear properties. In atomic physics, the electrons experience the force provided by an *external agent* (namely, the nucleus); in nuclear physics, there is no such external agent. The nucleus appears to hold itself together. In contrast to atomic physics, in which we often consider the interactions among the electrons as mere perturbations to the primary interaction between the electrons and nucleus, in nuclear physics the mutual interaction of the nuclear constituents is actually *what provides* the nuclear force, so we cannot treat this many-body problem as a correction to a single-body problem. We therefore cannot avoid the mathematical difficulties in the nuclear case as we did in the atomic case. 

The second difference between atomic and nuclear physics is that we cannot (yet?) write the nuclear force in a simple elegant form, as we do the Coulomb force. There is no closed-form analytical expression that can be written to describe the mutual attraction of the nuclear constituents.

In spite of these difficulties, we can learn a great deal about the properties of the nucleus by studying the interactions of different nuclei, their radioactive decay, and the properties of some nuclear constituents.

## Key Equations:

### **Alpha Decay**:

$$^A_ZX_N \to ^{A-4}_{Z-2}X'_{N-2} + ^4_2He_2 $$

$$Q = [m(X)-m(X')-m(^4He)]\;c^2. $$

$$K_\alpha \cong \frac{A-4}{A}Q. $$

### **Beta Decay**:

$$n \to p + e^- + \overline \nu. $$

$$^A_ZX_N\to ^A_{Z+1}X'_{N-1}+e^++\nu. $$ 

$$Q = [m(^AX)-m(^AX')]\;c^2 .$$ 

$$Q = E_{\bar \nu}+K_e+K_X' \cong E_{\bar \nu} + K_e. $$
or...

$$p + e^- \to n + \nu $$

$$^A_ZX_N\to ^A_{Z+1}X'_{N-1}+e^++\nu. $$ 

$$Q = [m(^AX)-m(^AX')-2m_e]\;c^2 $$

or...

$$p + e^- \to n + \nu $$

$$^A_ZX_N + e^- \to _{Z-1}^AX'_{N+1} + \nu $$

$$Q = [m(^AX)-m(^AX')]\;c^2. $$

### **Gamma Decay**:

$$E_\gamma = E_i- E_f - K_R \cong E_i- E_f. $$
