# Proper Motion:
***

We assume that the right ascension and declination ($RA\text{ and }\delta$ ) are constant, but in reality they are not, for two reasons:

- Stars move in space due to **proper motion**
- The tilt of the Earth's axis changes over time due to **precession**

***

Thus far we have modeled the movements of the stars as being on the surface of the celestial sphere (2-dimensional motion). But stars move in three dimensions, and the radial component of stellar motion is often invisible to us (but can be determined through spectroscopy and Doppler shift analysis).

Changes in the $RA$ and $\dd$ of the star is caused by motion *in the plane of the sky*. Only nearby or very fast-moving objects have detectable proper motion.

Tangential velocity cannot be measured directly. What we measure is motion across the sky in arcseconds per year, which we call **proper motion** $\mu("/yr)$.
