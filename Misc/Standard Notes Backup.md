- Movement
		- Learn about Inverse IK, predictive foot placement?
		- Physics jumps, several tiers, super jump
		- Call/Ride Mount System for GemSummons
		- Animal Locomotion AI, behavioral
		- Climbing/Parkour
- Combat
	- combo attacks
	- dismemberment/finishing moves
	- blood spray on slash - physics
	- enemy AI - seek and destroy, revulsion to magic
	- archery aim/camera - projectile, impalement, headshot
	- weapon swap w d-pad
	- crossbow mechanics/aim/fire
- Channelling
	- final skill tree for Seven Faculties (Lux, Ignis, Minera, Kinetica, Cognis, Aquus, Amperia)
	- spell switch mechanic - like HZD weapon wheel
	- Physics-based magic/dynamic lighting - not just lights that flash and do x points of damage - feel impact
- Gem Summoning: 
	- Party-Building - gem management - evolutionary?
	- The Web of Life is the connective energy-graph of all the various individual forms that life can make. the graph is structured such that the closeness of nodes represents the degree of physical similarity, such that different shapes emerge that represent different patterns of relations - evolutionary branches of similar morphologies. The Academy's union of human reason and Fae magic has yielded, yet again, incredible magical artifacts called Gems. Crystalline structures that conform mathematically to the soul-nodes of the Web of Life, Gems can tap into the mana of the biosphere to generate an Avatar - a solid holographic representation of a particular species from the particular Gem Region of the Gem, a perfect holotypic organism made entirely from the energy of the soul, entirely loyal to the cause of the Summoner. Thus different types of Gems allow you to summon avatars of different types of creature - it all depends on their crystalline structure. There is a crystal for birds and dinosaurs, for reptiles and amphibians, for mammals, for insects and arthropods, and for fish. A further innovation by Maerlyn the Enlightened - if the gems are beset into a metal of sufficient purity, the interaction of the alloy with the Elder Magick allows for connection to another expression of the Web, in some sense its derivative - the illogical biosphere of Faerie, often a dark reflection of the organisms on Ioterra. 

	- Party System - you will start very early on with one gem, a cracked one that cannot properly function, and can only produce one avatar - a young, adolescent Sphinx, which is cute as all hell and will be one of your main companions, as well as a convenient excuse to provide occasional exposition - which is basically permanently deployed. fixing the gem so he can rest and be safe will be an early plot priority. Each individual avatar you have can level up and grow stronger, and, since they are representative of entire classes of animal, each has a number of morphological variations (eg. a rhinoceros can have either zero, one, two three horns as the result of an upgrade). Animals from Ioterra and Faerie go through lifecycles - over time, they will grow rapidly in size, and proportion, and become more capable in combat. Some remain relatively small (eg. a fox), some grow incredible large (eg. dinosaurs, some dragons, trolls). They gain XP in combat and leveling up increases stats - milestone levels (5,10,20,50) change the appearance/size/animation of the animal (and sometimes, abilities develop later in the life cycle). Each gem has a capacity, the number of Avatars it can simultaneously hold, which can be upgraded and improved over time - starts at one, goes to three, five, nine - big upgrades though, not easy.  Though a careful practice taught at the academy, they can be geometrically refined in a number of ways - their structure can be updated such that one Gem can have multiple active Avatars at once (until max capacity can be summoned), and other Refinements can reveal more of the depth of the Web and can cause morphological changes/variants to the animal as it aligns with a different, deeper strand of the web. (cave bear/polar bear, greatwhite/hammerhead, etc. - minor gameplay changes, mostly aesthetic customization). At the beginning, you will have only the Sphinx, and as you progress through the game you create and raise a number of Avatars that will improve with you and grow alongside you - up to a full party of hydras, dragons, dinosaurs, mounts like pteranodons, elk, use wolves to help you track down a smell, explore underwater with whales and sharks and serpents, etc. 

	- So we need to: manage gems, collecting/unlocking them, which gem types have access to which animals, ability to have player realtime spawn the animal actor, needs useful, intelligent AI to be effective in combat - if we can somehow freaking pull that off, we make it realistic by studying animal behavior, making them feel organic/immersive (the opposite of the demons, who move unnaturally and unsettlingly) - when Avatars die in combat, they are disabled for some time (timer, simple) - begin to take damage if they exist in corporeal form for too long, must return to the gem and the Web to return to Equilibrium - if kept in tangible form perpetually, the animal will weaken and begin to wither, and eventually the connection to the Web will sever and the Gem will shatter. maybe idk. Hardest part going to be the animal AI, each will need a full set of locomotive and combat animations) - some will be mountable, some flying mounts, some utility animals, some better in combat than others - put together your team with synergy - sacred geometry - customize your loadout, train them, maybe you can give some armor, maybe a small skill tree of complicated attacks unique to the animal - combos with your own SoulBlade attacks? 

	- to unlock new animals to summon: find the gem compatible with that type of animal (side quests, couple from main plot, dungeons), ensure you have upgraded your own Refinery skill to the necessary level, Refine the gem to reveal a certain species, kill the certain animal in the real world (to earn the loyalty or smth) and capture it's soul in the gem. It now joins your party of Avatars, can be summoned from the gem, and will start to grow more powerful as it fights for you. 

	- by Training an Avatar (which can maybe be done inside the Gem? Beat the creature in a sparring match/chase?), you can customize the behavior of it's AI to an extent - conservative, defensive, aggressive, distract, even some certain special attacks for high level Training sessions
	
	- animals/creatures/demons sorted by rarity - common, uncommon, rare, legendary? Choice of 4 rare creatures at the end of the GemSummon Intro Quest - access to Sphinx, Parasaurolophus, Megaloceros, Centaur - all 4 mountable


### Design

- Skill Tree Final - order/actual graphic design for UI
- full character menu - on middle button - spells, gems, outfit, inventory, map, quests
- outfits and their gameplay benefits - list of at least ten 
- visual design of soulbow, animation/look of how the bow actually fires
- Enemies:
	- Demons: design look and hierarchy of demons - more philosophy, etc. 3 small lv.1 demons, 2 bigger lvl. 2, 1 lvl.3, and 1 colossal lv.5. Level 8s are titanic horrors, level 10s are anti-gods. the higher the level, the more individual character a demon has - lvl1 mobs are formless little thoughtforms, lvl2 might be like a gremlin type thing, lvl3. might be a humanoid, lvl4 a large humanoid or small beast, level 5 a giant/large monster, level 6 a fully-fledged archdemon with a name and followers, 7 and 8 more powerful archdemons, 9 the anti-renarii, there's only one 10 and you hope it's far, far away from where you are

	- Fascists: actually figure out who these guys are and what they believe in, fascism research, evolving look as party grows - from street movement to gang to organization to government to imperial power to a tyrannical religion. Make a couple light enemies, just random goons, a couple higher-ranked (Dark Knights?). More sophisticated AI

	- Unseelie:
		- the terrorist(?) group of fae, (start, and) finish design, motivations. The Unseelie Court is a group of renegade Fae that split from the Seelie Court after the Atlantean's warning of a demonic incursion. They were members of the Seelie Court that refused to keep the threat a secret, and instead urged the Fae to face the demons head-on, before they became strong enough to consume the energy of the planet. They saw (and see) total mobilization to destroy this incoming monster as the only path to survival. They might be right, but their methods are unacceptable - they enslaved other powerful races, such as the vampyres and lycanths, that once scattered the whole of Faerie. IT was a secret deal with the Seelie Court - the Unseelie were excommunicated eternally with the elder magick, lest they leak the demonic secret, but the Seelie allowed its dark twin to occupy the lands far to the east of the continent, and said nothing as they built their holy army in the dark - the Unseelie Court was keeping out the undesirables. But the extremism of the dark Fae does not come enthusiastically - they act out of a primal obligation to preserve existence, similar to the Knights-Errant, and do their penance by enslaving themselves voluntarily to the Court, sacrificing every pleasure to devote themselves entirely to the fight against the Demons. Dark against Void. Their obsession stems from their guilt. They should not have ignored the warnings of the Atlanteans. 

		- somewhat inspired by dark elves from GOW2018, insectoid - 3 different light enemies, footsoldiers, enslaved dark fae-kind (vampyre, lycanth, husk, captive (dark gems?) basilisk, hydra)

# Characters

### Protagonists:

- Jacelyn Seraph, Changeling
	- Base mesh (tentatively done, makehuman->mixamo->unreal pipeline works) - may have to redo hair for hair sim, make a separate object, also may redo skin texture/eye texture in substance

	- Academy Uniform - marvelous designer->blender retopo?->unreal - still need to figure out pipeline - paint in substance painter - colored tunic (color variants based on which Faculty is dominant) with white hooded cloak, golden metal trim, black leather boots, iron bracer for gems (which, for plot reasons, doesn't sit well with Jacelyn, so she uses leather straps/jewellery), big belt with lots of pouches to hold books/back of cloak, as well as where the SoulBlade/SoulBow/SlingShot (later) will be holstered


	- Animations:

		- walk/run cycle, directional, preferably mocap
		- jump/crouch/other basic locomotion, same as above
		- sword combat mocap animset (if a good one can be found for cheapish, need multi-hit combos and as many of the specific planned moves we need) otherwise find reference and manually animate in blender
		- archery animset - try to find a mocap archery animset, don't need many, most of the work will be in animating the actual bow firing itself w/ the soul energy
		- gem summon anim - browse mixamo/free spell animations, but use them as a rough base and tweak/alter the animation yourself in blender
		- channelling character animations - look at reference animsets, but these will mostly be animated from scratch, as they need to be unique and *visceral*
