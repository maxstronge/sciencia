There are some general rules and patterns for making trigonometric simplifications, especially when dealing with complex exponentials. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. Euler's Formula

The first step is to recognize that Euler's formula $e^{ix}=cos⁡(x)+isin⁡(x)$ can be used to convert complex exponentials into trigonometric functions.

### 2. Conjugate Pairs

If you see terms like$e^{ix}+e^{-ix}$ or $e^{ix}-e^{-ix}$, you can immediately think of trigonometric simplifications. These are often simplified to $2\cos⁡(x)$ and $2i\sin⁡(x)$, respectively.

### 3. Division by $i$

If you see a term divided by $i$, it's often a clue that a sine function will appear after simplification. For example, $\frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}=\sin x$.

### 4. Division by Real Numbers

If you see a term divided by a real number, it often indicates that a cosine function will appear. For example, eix+e−ix2=cos⁡(x)2eix+e−ix​=cos(x).

### 5. Look for Symmetry

If the integral or sum has symmetric limits or terms, trigonometric simplifications can often eliminate one of the trigonometric functions, making the expression simpler.

### 6. Complex Coefficients

If you see complex coefficients, try to separate the real and imaginary parts. This often leads to terms that can be simplified using trigonometric identities.

### Summary

1. **Euler's Formula**: Always the starting point for these kinds of simplifications.
2. **Conjugate Pairs**: Look for eix±e−ixeix±e−ix terms.
3. **Division by ii**: Usually leads to sine functions.
4. **Division by Real Numbers**: Usually leads to cosine functions.
5. **Symmetry**: Can simplify the expression further.
6. **Complex Coefficients**: Separate them to find more simplifications.

By recognizing these patterns, you can often make quick trigonometric simplifications in complex exponential expressions.
