# 10.2 - Rotation about a Fixed Axis:
***

The results of the [[10.1 - Properties of the Center of Mass|previous section]] demonstrate the importance of rotational motion. For example, the kinetic energy of a rigid body flying through the air (like a juggler's pin, or a marching band's baton) 	is the sum of two terms: the **translational energy** of the *CM* moving through the air, and the **rotational energy** of the object spinning about the *CM*. The former we understand rather completely, but the latter requires former study, and is the subject of much of the rest of this chapter. 

In this section we'll analyze the special case of a body that is rotating about a fixed axis. First, let's examine its angular momentum:

Because the axis of rotation is fixed, we can agree to call it the *z*-axis, with the origin *O* somewhere on the axis of rotation. As usual, we imagine the body divided into many small pieces of mass $m_\alpha$, $(\alpha = 1,\,2,...\,N$). The angular momentum is given by the usual formula:


> ## $$ \boldsymbol L = \sum \ell_\alpha = \sum r_\alpha \times m_\alpha v_\alpha. $$

^d47776

The velocities $v_\alpha$ here are the velocities *with which the pieces of the body are being carried in circles around the CM by the body's rotational velocity*, $\omega$. As [[9.2 - Relation between Linear and Angular Velocity|we saw earlier]], these velocities are just $v_\alpha = \omega \times r_\alpha$. With our *z*-axis along $\omega$, the components of $\omega$ are:

> ## $$\vec \omega = (0,0,\omega) $$

...and the position is:

> ## $$\vec r_\alpha = (x_\alpha, y_\alpha, z_\alpha). $$

Thus, the cross-product $v_\alpha =  \omega \times r_\alpha$ has components:

> ## $$\vec v_\alpha = \vec \omega \times \vec r_\alpha = (-\omega y_\alpha, \omega x_\alpha, 0) .$$

Finally, we can write the components of the angular momentum as:

> ### $$\vec \ell _\alpha = m_\alpha \vec r_\alpha \times \vec v_\alpha = m_\alpha \omega \left( -z_\alpha x_\alpha, -z_\alpha y_\alpha,\; x^2_\alpha + y^2_\alpha\right). $$

If we put the z-component of this result into the [[10.2 - Rotation about a Fixed Axis#^d47776|expression for the total angular momentum of the body]], we find that the *z*-component of the *total* angular momentum is:

> ## $$\boldsymbol{L}_z = \sum m_\alpha \left( x_\alpha^2 + y_\alpha^2 \right)\,\omega. $$

We can express the quantity $(x_\alpha^2 + y_\alpha^2)$ as $\rho_\alpha^2$ , where, as usual, $\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ denotes *the distance of any point* $(x,y,z)$ from the *z*-axis. Therefore:

> ## $$\boldsymbol{L}_z = \sum m_\alpha \rho _\alpha^2 \omega = \boldsymbol I _z \omega $$

...where $\boldsymbol I$ is the familar **moment of inertia** about the *z*-axis - the sum of all constituent masses, each multiplied by the square of its distance from the *z*-axis. 

> ## $$\boldsymbol I_z = \sum m_\alpha \rho_\alpha^2 .$$ 

Thus, we have proved the familar result that:

> #### $$\text{angular momentum} = \text{moment of inertia} \times \text{angular velocity}. $$

Note, though, that the angular momentum in the above expression is just the *z*-component of the total angular momentum, and only for rotation about the *z*-axis.

***
With the gratifying result above, we can now calculate the kinetic energy of our rotating body: 

> ## $$T = \frac{1}{2}\sum m_\alpha v_\alpha^2 $$

Noting that the speed of $m_\alpha$ as it is carried around the *z*-axis with angular velocity $\omega$ is $v_\alpha = (x^2_\alpha + y^2_\alpha) = \rho_\alpha \omega$, we can rewrite this as:

> ## $$T = \frac{1}{2} \sum m_\alpha \rho_\alpha^2 \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol I_z \omega^2. $$ 

Another familiar result from intro mechanics!


***

So far we have encountered no suprises, but when we calculate the *x* and *y* components of $\boldsymbol{L}$ we come across something unexpected. If we substitute the [[10.2 - Rotation about a Fixed Axis#^8bc8ef|x and y components]] of $\vec \ell$ into the [[10.2 - Rotation about a Fixed Axis#^d47776|total angular momentum]]:

> $$\LARGE\boldsymbol{L}_x = - \sum m_\alpha x_\alpha z_\alpha\omega \qquad \text{and} \qquad \boldsymbol L_y = - \sum m_\alpha y_\alpha z_\alpha \omega.$$

^788d4e

In general, these sums are *not zero* (as we'll see in a moment), and we have the following surprising conclusion: the angular velocity $\omega$ points in the *z*-direction, because the body is rotating about the *z*-axis, *but*, since since $\boldsymbol{L}_x$ and $\boldsymbol{L}_y$ can be *nonzero*, the total angular momentum $\boldsymbol{L}$ may be in a *different direction!* That is, the angular momentum may not always be oriented in the same direction as the angular velocity, and the general result $\boldsymbol{L} = \boldsymbol I \omega$ is *not* always true!

![[Pasted image 20210422133747.png]]

More generally, the question of whether or not $\boldsymbol{L}$ and $\omega$ are parallel is an important issue throughout the study of rotating bodies, and leads us to the important concept of **principal axes**, as is discussed [[10.4 - Principal Axes of Inertia|in this section.]]

## Products of Inertia:

We need to collect and streamline our results and notation for the angular momentum of a body rotating about the *z*-axis. As is clear from [[10.2 - Rotation about a Fixed Axis#^788d4e|our work so far]], the *y* and *x* components of $\boldsymbol{L}$ are proportional to $\omega$. The constants of proportionality are generally denoted by $\boldsymbol I_{xz}$ and $\boldsymbol I_{yz}$, so that we can rewrite [[10.2 - Rotation about a Fixed Axis#^788d4e|this expression]] as:

> $$\LARGE\boldsymbol{L}_x = \boldsymbol I_{xz}\,\omega \qquad \text{and} \qquad \boldsymbol L_y = \boldsymbol I_{yz}\,\omega$$
> where...
> $$\LARGE\boldsymbol{I}_{xz} = - \sum m_\alpha x_\alpha z_\alpha\qquad\text{and}\qquad \boldsymbol{I}_{yz} = -\sum m_\alpha y_\alpha z_\alpha,$$
> or, for continuous mass distributions, we can use integral notation...
> $$\LARGE \boldsymbol{I}_{xz} =\; - \underset{object}\int xz\;dm \qquad \text{and} \qquad \boldsymbol{I}_{yz} =\; - \underset{object}\int yz\;dm.$$


The two coefficients $\boldsymbol{I}_{xz}$ and $\boldsymbol{I}_{yz}$ are called the **products of inertia** of the body. 

The rationale for this new notation is that $\boldsymbol{I}_{xz}$ tells us the *x*-component of $\boldsymbol{L}$ when $\omega$ is in the *z*-direction, and likewise for $\boldsymbol{I}_{yz}$. To conform with this notation, we will have to rename $\boldsymbol{I}_z$, the old-fashioned moment of inertia about the *z*-axis, and call it $\boldsymbol{I}_{zz}$:

> $$\LARGE \boldsymbol{I}_{zz} = \sum m_\alpha \left( x_\alpha^2 + y_\alpha^2 \right) = \sum m_\alpha \rho_\alpha^2.$$

With this notation, we can now say that, for a body rotating about the *z*-axis, the **total angular momentum** is:

> ## $$\vec{\boldsymbol L}  = (\boldsymbol{I}_{xz}\omega, \boldsymbol{I}_{yz}\omega,\boldsymbol{I}_{zz}\omega).$$
