# Course Outline:

**Professor**:
	Dr. Avram Lytton - avram.lytton@ucalgary.ca

**TAs:**
	Vicki Sotvedt (vmmcgowa@ucalgary.ca),Ozinna Ntukogu (ozinna.ntukogu@ucalgary.ca)

## **Course Description:**

This course introduces students to the main historical themes that influenced the development of the modern world from roughly the sixteenth century to the late twentieth century. By doing so, students will appreciate how the present is often shaped by the past, and how ideas, culture,
politics, conflict, economics, technology, and institutions have contributed to the construction of the “modern” globalized world. Particular emphasis will be placed on international relations and global economics.

## **Learning Outcomes**:

This course will familiarize students with important interpretations of world history and give them insight into the interconnectedness of world history with the present. It will also develop their ability to interpret historical sources and make arguments within historical debates. Finally, it will further develop students’ skills in analysis, source comprehension, communication, critical thinking, and argumentation.

## **Group Work:**

Beginning September 15, every Friday class (except for Friday October 13 when group work will be shifted to the following Monday October 16), students will discuss readings that have been posted by the instructor on D2L. Students will form into small groups to discuss questions about the sources they have read, before joining in a general class discussion. There will be $11$ class discussions, participation in each is worth $1\%$ of the final grade, for a maximum total of $10\%$. Participation will be assessed via the group work assignments. If you anticipate missing more than one group work, please let me know and alternative arrangements can be made, at the discretion of the instructor.

## Midterm:

Written for $50$ minutes in class on Wednesday October 18th.  It will consist of identification (short answer, what is this and why is it important, choose 2 or 3 from a list, 1 paragraph) questions and one essay (again out of several options) question based on the course lectures and readings. More information will be provided by the instructor in class and on D2L. There will be a bonus question on something somewhat trivial to test for paying attention in class.

## Research Paper:

Students will submit paper of ~$2000$ words on related topics. Need at least 8 academic sources, follow formatting for history paper (see [[history-students-handbook-2019.pdf|History Student's Handbook]]) 

## Final:
