# Optical Telescopes:

Telescopes are the primary instrument used to study astronomy.

The telescope fulfills three major tasks in astronomical observations:

1. It collects light from a large area, making it possible to study very faint light sources.
2. It increases the *apparent* angular diameter of the object and improves the resolution (drastically, compared to the human eye)
3. It is used to measure the positions of objects.

The light-collecting surface inside a telescope is either a *lens* or a *mirror* - thus, optical telescopes are divided into two types: lens telescopes, called **refractors**, and mirror telescopes, called **reflectors**.

### Geometric Optics - Refractors:

Refractors have two lenses: the **objective** lens, which collects incoming light and forms an image in the **focal plane**, and the **eyepiece**, a small magnifying glass for looking at the image. 

The lenses are on opposite sides of a tube, which can be directed towards any desired point. The distance between the eyepiece and the focal plane can be adjusted to get the image into focus.

The *diameter* of the objective lens, denoted $D$, is called the **aperture** of the telescope (this also applies to the diameter of the mirror of reflectors). 

The ratio of the aperture $D$ to the focal length $f, \, F=D / f$, is called the **aperture ratio**, a quantity used to characterize the light-gathering power of the telescope. If the aperture ratio is large (~1), the telescope image is very bright, which means photographs can be taken with short exposure. Smaller aperture ratios lead to dimmer images $\implies$ longer exposures necessary ('slow telescope'). 

In the first refractor telescopes, which had a simple objective lens, the observations were hampered by the **chromatic abberation**. Since glass reflects all different wavelengths of light by slightly different amounts, all the colors do not meet at a single focal point, but the focal length *increases with wavelength*.

### Reflectors: 

Reflectors are now the most common telescope in modern astrophysical research. For a light-collecting surface, reflectors employ a mirror coated with a thin layer of aluminum. These mirrors are typically parabolic in shape - a parabolic mirror reflects all light rays entering the telescope *parallel to the main axis* into the *same* focal point. 

The image formed at this point can be observed through an eyepiece, as in refractor telescopes, or registered with a detector. One of the advantages of reflector telescopes is the absence of chromatic aberration due to the way the mirror reflects wavelengths to a single focal point.

### Types of Reflector Telescope:

In very large telescopes, the observer can sit with their instruments in a special cage at the **primary focus** (see above) without eclipsing too much of th eincoming light - in smaller telescopes this is not possible, and the image must be inspected from outside the telescope. 

The first practical reflecting telescope was built by Sir Isaac Newton. The light is guided perpendicularly out from the telescope with a small flat mirror - the focus of the image in such a telescope is therefore called the **Newton focus**. 

Another possibility is to bore a hole at the center of the primary mirror, and reflect the rays through it with a small *hyperbolic* secondary mirror in the front end of the telescope. In these designs, the rays meet in what is called the **Cassegrain focus**.  The Cassegrain is a common design, used to make compact telescopes with long focal lengths, which are good for large fields of view.
