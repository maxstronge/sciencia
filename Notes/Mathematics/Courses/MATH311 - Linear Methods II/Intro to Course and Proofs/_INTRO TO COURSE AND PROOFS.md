## Proof Assignment: 

- Recall that a matrix $\bf{A}$ is *symmetric* if $\bf{A}$ = $\bf{A}^T$, and is called *skew-symmetric* if $\bf{A}^T = -\bf{A}$. 
- Determine whether the following statements are true or false. If true, provide a proof. If false, provide an explicit counterexample. 


	1. Suppose $\bf{A}$ and $\bf{B}$ are skew-symmetric, and $\bf{AB} = \bf{BA}$. Then, $\bf{BA}$ is skew-symmetric.


		-  Thus, $\bf{A}$
