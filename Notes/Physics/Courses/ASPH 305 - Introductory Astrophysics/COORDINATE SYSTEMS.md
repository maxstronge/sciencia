Astronomy is a challenging science due to the fact that we are limited to observing the universe from our vantage point on Earth - so we need to use units much larger than the ones that we intuitively use for planet-scale effects. 

The scale of astronomical phenomena range from meters (spacecraft) to gigaparsecs (billions of parsecs, large-scale cosmic structure). 

**Star**: large gaseous body held together by gravity, generates energy through nuclear fusion

**Solar system**: group of astronomical bodies held in orbit by a parent star


**Galaxy**: large collection of solar systems that orbit a center (often a black hole)

**Local Group**: large group of galaxies that are gravitationally bound and held together by a shared center of mass

In the modern era, humans are much less connecte to the night sky than earlier in our history due to industrialization/light pollution/etc. We do, however, have much better tools and theories that allow us to see more than ever before (space telescopes, *GR*) so long as we know how (and where) to look.

The foundations of modern astronomy are built on ancient ideas, which we will need to refamiliarize ourselves with to proceed further.

Early human civilizations believed that all heavenly objects were embedded in the surface of crystalline spheres encircling the Earth. This **celestial sphere** was thought to rotate around the Earth, causing the daily rise & set of the Sun and stars. 

This obviously is not literally true, but it does provide a convenient tool to map the night sky and analyze the motions of heavenly bodies. 

To identify celestial objects, we can temporarily ignore the distance to the stars and simply describe their position as if they were points on the celestial sphere (at an infinite distance away).

The **celestial poles** are the *intersections* of the Earth's *rotation axis* with the celestial sphere. Effectually, this is the rotational axis of the celestial sphere. 

The **celestial equator** is the projection of the Earth's *equatorial plane* onto the celestial sphere. 

Observing the night sky, you will note the apparent rise and fall of each star as it rises to a maximum height and then sets. One star in particular, **Polaris**, is remarkably close to the *northern celestial pole*, and as such appears to remain relatively fixed throughout the night.

The night sky / celestial sphere is divided (completely arbitrarily/by convention) into 88 distinct regions called **constellations**. There is no standard of shape/size for these constellations, but the entire visible celestial sphere is divided into these regions. Every star that falls within that particular region (eg. Orion) belongs to that constellation. 

Random groupings of stars sometimes resemble objects, and were identified by early humans by the shapes they form, called **asterisms**. For example, the asterism of Orion is a series of stars that appears to resemble a warrior/hunter. Note: an asterism is only the collection of stars that make up the iconographic image - not all stars in a constellation will be a part of the asterism.

Stars in a constellation/asterism are, of course, at radically different distances, not all equidistant on the surface of a sphere. What we see from earth is roughly equivalent to a two-dimensional projection of the stars on the surface of the celestial sphere, but the distances of these stars (measured radially outwards from the earth) can vary by orders of magnitude.
