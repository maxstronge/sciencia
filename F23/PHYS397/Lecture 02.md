# Scintillation Detectors:

- each group will get their own detector



## Scintillator Components

- $5x5x1$ cm plastic scintillator - sensitive to radiation, will emit light to be picked up by a sensor
- detector
	- contains silicon photomultiplier
- built (more or less) for cosmic rays

## Cosmic Rays

Start with a high-energy hadron (proton, hydrogen nucleus, etc)

-> it collides with particles in the atmosphere releasing other particles, mesons, etc
