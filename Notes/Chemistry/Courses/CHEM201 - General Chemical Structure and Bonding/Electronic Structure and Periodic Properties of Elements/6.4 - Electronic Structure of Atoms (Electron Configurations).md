# 6.4 - Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron Configurations):

***

Having introduced the basics of atomic structure and [[_The SchrÃ¶dinger Equation|quantum mechanics]], we can use our understanding of *quantum numbers* to determine how atomic orbitals relate to one another. This allows us to determine which orbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of the chemical properties of the atom.

### Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure:

The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the [[7.1 - A One-Dimensional Atom|principal quantum number]], *n*, increases. This is the first number in the different states on the diagram below: *n* goes from 1, at the bottom, to 6 at the top.  In any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of **subshells** with different values of $\ell$ (the second quantum number, has to do with angular momentum) differ, so that the energy of the orbitals *increases* within a shell in this order:

> ### $$s < p < d < f.$$

The *1s* at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy (most stable / least reactive).  

**NOTE FOR NON-PHYS MAJORS**: don't worry about what s, p, d, and f stand for. It doesn't really mean anything, they're just labels that we give to different quantum states. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number $\ell$ (don't worry about what it does either) can take on different values, and we call those values *s*,* p*, *d*, and *f*.

The energy increases as we move up to the *2s*, *2p*, *3s*, and *3p* levels - notice that the increasing *n* value has more impact on the energy than the increasing $\ell$ value, at least for small atoms. This pattern does not hold for larger atoms, though (notice that the *4s* orbital is lower in energy than the *3d* orbital, so it comes first). 

You will note that the energy levels of the electrons are **quantized** - they can't take on any value, but they can only take on certain discrete values. This is the basis of quantum theory, and is all the word 'quantum' means - discrete, not continuous.

Successive atoms on the periodic table fill up these shells **in order**, according to the diagram above. Again: as the principal quantum number *n* goes up $\to$ the electron gets further and further from the nucleus $\to$ the electron has more energy $\to$ the electron is less stable/more reactive. 

Because the electrons and the nucleus are attracted to each other by the **Coulomb** (electric force), the strength of the force decreases as the square of the distance between them increases (like gravity). This explains why the electron is less stable when it's further away from the nucleus: the force holding them together gets weaker the further away they get. 

But the attractive force between the positively-charged nucleus and the negatively-charged electron is not the only effect we have to consider: if there are two or more electrons orbiting the same nucleus, those electrons will *repel each other*. There are typically more electrons closer to the nucleus, so the higher-density cluster of electrons near the nucleus *pushes* on the more distant ones, resulting in a phenomenon called **shielding**. Here's that earlier diagram again for reference:

Shielding is the reason that *2p*, for example, is 'pushed' a little further out from *2s*. For the first few shells, the increase in *n* will be more significant than the increase in $\ell$, as mentioned before: but you'll notice that as the atom gets bigger, this isn't always the case. For example, the shift from *4s* $\to$ *3d* happens before the *4p* transition. There a bunch of helpful tricks you can use to remember what order they go in, but just memorizing them might come in handy. 

To recap: the arrangement of various electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the **electron configuration** of the atom. 

The electron configuration can be described by a label that contains 3 pieces of information: 


1. The principal quantum number *n* . This tells you what the primary shell is. 
2. The letter that denotes the secondary quantum number ($\ell$), which can be *s,p,d, or f*. This defines the subshell, and with this + the last point, you can describe exactly which subshell you're talking about (1s, 4f, etc. )
3. A superscript number that tells you how many electrons are in that particular subshell (for example, $2p^4$ means that *n* = 2, $\ell$ = p, and there are 4 electrons in that shell).

There are a few principles we can use to determine the electron configuration for any atom, listed below:

### The Aufbau Principle:

The German word "Aufbau" means "to build up" - and with the Aufbau Principle, we can determine the electronic structure of any atom by 'building up' from the previous ones, in the order of the atomic numbers (starting at 1 for hydrogen and increasing through the periodic table). Starting with hydrogen, we can add one proton at a time to the nucleus, and one electron to the outermost subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. Some important points regarding the Aufbau principle:

- Each new electron that is added occupies the lowest-energy subshell that *has not yet been filled* (in the order shown in Fig. 6.24, above).
- Electrons enter higher-energy subshells *only* after the lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity (same as the above, but slightly reworded for emphasis)
