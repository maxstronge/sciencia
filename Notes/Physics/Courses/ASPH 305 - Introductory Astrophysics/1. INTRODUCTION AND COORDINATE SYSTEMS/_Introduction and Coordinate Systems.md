# Spherical Astronomy: 

___


Spherical astronomy is a science studying **astronomical coordinate frames**, directions and  apparent motions of celestial objects, determination of position from astronomical observations, etc. 

We shall concentrate mostly on astronomical coordinates, apparent motions of stars, and time reckoning. We will also introduce some of the most important star catalogues. 

For simplicity, we will assume that the observer is always in the *northern hemisphere*. In spherical astronomy, all angles are typically expressed in degrees.
