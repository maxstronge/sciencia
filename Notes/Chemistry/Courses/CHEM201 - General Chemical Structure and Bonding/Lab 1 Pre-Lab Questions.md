## Lab 1 - Pre-Lab Questions:

1. What is the overall balanced equation obtained when *1* and *2* are combined?


**Eq. 1**: 	$\ce{NaHCO3 _\aq + HCl _\aq \longrightarrow H2CO3 _\aq + NaCl _\aq}$

**Eq. 2**: $\ce{H2CO3 _\aq \longrightarrow H2O _\liq + CO2 _\gas }$

To combine the equations, we place all the reactants on the left, all the products on the right, and cancel out any species that appear on both sides of the arrow - in this case, $\ce{H2CO3 _\aq}$. The resulting chemical equation is:


>$$\ce{NaHCO3 _\aq + HCl _\aq \longrightarrow NaCl _\aq + H2O _\liq + CO2 _\gas_}$$

The equation requires no further balancing.

3. Limiting vs. Excess Reactants:


> **C**: The $\ce{HCl _\aq}$ was the excess reactant in the described experiment. 
>
> **E**: The pH of the resulting solution was $2$. 
>
> **R**: The low pH of the resulting solution implies that after the reaction, the resulting solution was acidic. Therefore, the $\ce{HCl}$, a strong acid, must have been the excess reactant.
