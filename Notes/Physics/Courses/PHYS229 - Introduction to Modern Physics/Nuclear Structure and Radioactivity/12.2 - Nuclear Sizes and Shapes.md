# 12.2 - Nuclear Sizes and Shapes
***

Like atoms, nuclei lack a hard surface or an easily definable radius. In fact, different experiments can often reveal different radii for the same nucleus! 

We know some general features of the nuclear density. Because the nuclear force is the strongest of the forces, we might expect that it might cause the protons and neutrons to congregate at the center of the nucleus, meaning that the density of the central region would increase as more nucleons are added. This turns out not to be the case:

As the figure shows, the density remains quite uniform, which gives us some important clues about the short range of the nuclear force. 

Another interesting feature of Figure 12.1 is that the density of a nucleus seems not to depend on the mass number *A*; very light nuclei (like $^{12}C$) seem to have *roughly the same central density* as very heavy nuclei, such as $^{209}Bi$. 

Stated another way, the number of protons and neutrons per unit volume is approximately constant over the entire range of nuclei:

>### $$ \frac{number \; of \; neutrons \; and \; protons}{volume \; of \; nucleus} = \frac{A}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \cong constant. $$

...assuming the nucleus to be a sphere of radius *R*. Thus, $A \propto R^3$, which suggests a proportionality between the nuclear radius *R* and the cube root of the mass number: $R \propto A^\frac{1}{3}$, or, defining a constant of proportionality ** $R_0$**:

>### $$ R = R_0 A^\frac{1}{3}.$$

This constant $R_0$ must be determined by experiment (scattering, etc.) From such experiments, we know the value of $R_0$ is approximately:

>### $$ R_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-15} m. $$

The length $10^{-15}m$ is 1 *femtometer (fm)*, but physicists often refer to this length as one **fermi**, after Enrico Fermi.
