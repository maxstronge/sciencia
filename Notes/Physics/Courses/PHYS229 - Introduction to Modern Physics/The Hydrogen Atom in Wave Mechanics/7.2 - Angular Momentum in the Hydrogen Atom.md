# 7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom: 

***

**Angular momentum** played a significant role in Bohr's analysis of the structure of the hydrogen atom. Bohr was able to obtain the correct energy levels by assuming that *in the orbit with **quantum number** n*, the *angular momentum of the electron* is equal to $n\hbar$. Bohr's idea of **"quantization of angular momentum"** turned out to have some correct features, but the analysis is not entirely consistent with our current understanding of the quantum mechanical nature of angular momentum.

> ## Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics:

Quantum mechanics gives us a very different view of angular momentum. The angular momentum properties of a three-dimensional wave function are described by two **quantum numbers**.

The first is the **angular momentum quantum number**, *l*. This quantum number determines the length of the **angular momentum vector**:

> ## $$\vert \vec{L}\vert = \sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar \qquad (l = 0,1,2,...) $$

^e1f5a6

This is very different from the Bohr condition $\vert \vec{L} \vert = n \hbar$. In particular, it is now possible for the quantum
vector to have a length of zero, where in the Bohr model the minimum length is $\hbar$.

The second number we use to describe angular momentum in quantum mechanics is the **magnetic quantum number** $m_l$. This quantum number tells us about one component of the angular momentum vector, which we usually take to be the *z*-component. The relationship between the *z*-component of $\vec{L}$ and the magnetic quantum number $m_l$ is:

> ## $$L_z = m_l \hbar \qquad (m_l = 0,	\pm1,\pm2,...\pm l). $$

^6cb913

Note that for each value of *l*, there are $2l+1$ possible values of $m_l$.

Unlike the classical angular momentum vector, which we specify exactly using three numbers, the quantum mechanical angular momentum is described by *only two* numbers. Clearly two numbers alone cannot completely identify a vector in three-dimensional space, so something is missing from this description.  As we will discuss later, the missing piece comes from the [[7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom#^d49cd0|application of the uncertainty principle to angular momentum.]]

The components for the vector $\vec{L}$ for $l = 2$ are illustrated above. Each orientation in space of the $\vec{L}$ vector corresponds to a different value of $m_l$ (clearly the magnitude remains constant, so the different possibilities shown here do not depend on *l* ).

The polar angle $\theta$ that the vector $\vec{L}$ makes with the *z*-axis can be found by referring to the figure. 

With $L_z = \vec{L}\cos(\theta)$, we have:

> ## $$\cos(\theta)= \frac{L_z}{\vert \vec{L}\vert} = \frac{m_l}{\sqrt{l(l+1)}}$$

^51eec5

...where we've used our definitions for [[7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom#^6cb913| Lz ]] and [[7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom#^e1f5a6|the magnitude of L]].

This behavior represents a curious aspect of quantum mechanics called **spatial quantization** - only certain orientations of the angular momentum vector are allowed. The number of these is equal to $2l+1$ (the number of different possible values for $m_l$), and the magnitudes of their different respective *z*-components *always differ by exactly* $\hbar$. For example, an angular momentum state with $l = 1$ can have $m_l$ values of $-1, 0, or 1$ (according to [[7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom#^6cb913|the definition]]), which correspond to *z*-components $L_z = +\hbar, 0$, or $-\hbar$. 

From this, [[7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom#^51eec5|we can determine]] the possible values of $\cos(\theta)$ are $\frac{+1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0$, and $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Therefore, the $\vec{L}$ vector can only have one of three possible orientations relative to the *z*-axis in this case: $45^\circ, 90^\circ$, or $135^\circ$.

> ## The Angular Momentum Uncertainty Relationship:

^d49cd0

In quantum mechanics, the maximum amount of permitted information about the angular momentum vector is its [[7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom#^e1f5a6}}|length]] and its [[7.2 - Angular Momentum in the Hydrogen Atom#^6cb913|z-component]]. Because the complete description of a three-dimensional vector requires *three numbers*, we are always missing some information about the angular momentum of a quantum state. If we specify $\vert\vec{L}\vert$ and $L_z$ exactly, then *we have no information* about the other components of $\vec{L}$ (namely, $L_x$ and $L_y$).

Therefore, a measurement of $L_x$ or $L_y$ can result in *any outcome* (so long as $\vert \vec{L}\vert^2 = L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2$).

In graphic terms, we can visualize the tip of the $\vec{L}$ vector as rotating (or **precessing**) about the *z*-axis such that $L_z$ remains fixed, but $L_x$ and $L_y$ are undetermined:

![[Pasted image 20210418164945.png]]

This rotation *cannot be directly measured* - all we can possibly observe is the "smeared out" **distribution** of the values of $L_x$ and $L_y$.

There is thus an uncertainty/indeterminacy in specifying $\vec{L}$ that is summarized by another form of the **uncertainty principle**:

>## $$\Delta L_z \Delta\phi \geq \hbar $$

^ca5267

...where $\phi$ is the **azimuthal angle** as shown in the figure above. If we know $L_z$ exactly (such that $\Delta L_z = 0$), then the uncertainty in $\phi$ becomes infinite, and we have no information whatsoever. All values are equally probable. Whenever one component of $\vec{L}$ is determined, the other components *become completely undetermined*.

Alternately, if we constructed an angular momentum state in which $L_x$ was completely specified (such that $\phi$ would become known), *the state becomes a **superposition** of different* $L_z$ *values*. This is exactly the same type of behavior described by the other forms of the uncertainty principle.
