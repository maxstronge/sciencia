(Written in terms of the [[6.5 - The Bohr Model#^d773ed|Bohr Radius]],$a_0$.)

For the ground state (n = 1), only $l = 0$ and $m_l = 0$ are allowed. The complete
set of quantum numbers for the ground state is then $(n, l,m_l) = (1, 0, 0)$,
and the wave function for this state is given in the first line of Table 7.1. The
first excited state $(n = 2)$ can have $l = 0$ or $l = 1$. For $l = 0$, only $m_l = 0$ is allowed. This state has quantum numbers (2, 0, 0), and its wave function is given in the second line of Table 7.1. 

For l = 1, we can have ml = 0 or ±1. There are thus three possible sets of quantum numbers: (2, 1, 0) and (2, 1,±1). The wave functions for these states are given in the third and fourth lines of the table.

For the $n = 2$ level, there are four different possible sets of quantum
numbers and correspondingly four different wave functions. All of these wave
functions correspond to the same energy, so the $n = 2$ level is **degenerate**.

The n = 3 level is degenerate with nine possible sets of quantum numbers. In general, the level with principal quantum number *n* has a degeneracy equal to $n^2$.
