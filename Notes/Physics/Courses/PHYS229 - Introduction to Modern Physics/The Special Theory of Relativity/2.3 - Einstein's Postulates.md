# 2.3 - Einstein's Postulates:
***

The **special theory of relativity** is based on two postulates proposed by Albert Einstein in $1905_{CE}$:
***

##### **The Principle of Relativity**:
- The laws of physics are the *same* in all **inertial reference frames**. There is *no* 'preferred frame'.  ^709a15

##### ** The Principle of the Consistency of the Speed of Light**:

- The speed of light moving through free space has the same value, ***c***, in *all* inertial reference frames.

***
The second postulate is more difficult to accept because it seems to go against our “common sense,” which is based on the Galilean kinematics we observe in everyday experiences. Consider three observers A, B, and C.

Observer B is at rest, while A and C move away from B in opposite directions each at a speed of *c ∕ 4*. B fires a light beam in the direction of A. According to the Galilean transformation, if B measures a speed of *c* for the light beam, then A measures a speed of *c* − *c* ∕ 4 = 3*c* ∕ 4, while C measures a speed of *c* + *c* ∕ 4 = 5*c* ∕ 4. Einstein’s second postulate, on the other hand, requires all three observers to measure the same speed of *c* for the light beam!


This postulate immediately explains the failure of the *Michelson–Morley experiment*—the upstream–downstream and cross-stream speeds are identical (both are equal to *c*), so there is no phase difference between the two beams. 

The two postulates also allow us to dispose of the **ether hypothesis**. The first postulate does not permit a *preferred frame of reference* (all inertial frames are
equivalent), and the second postulate does not permit only a single frame of reference in which light moves at speed* c*, because light moves at speed *c *in all frames. The ether, as a preferred reference frame in which light has a unique speed, is therefore unnecessary.
